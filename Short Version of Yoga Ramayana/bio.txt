Ramayana explains Yoga concepts and their relationships using a story. The characters represent fundamental concepts of Yoga. For example, Shri Ram represents Consciousness, Sita represents Energy, and Hanumana represents Prana, etc. 

Hanuman is a representation of Prana. We take Prana from the air, and in Ramayana, he is a son of Air god (Vayu). One of the crucial roles of Prana is to find dormant Energy locked up in the Muladhara chakra. In Ramayana, we see that job of Hanuman was to find Sita, who was locked up in Lanka.

In Ramayana, Sita went through fire because she represents Energy, and fire is a form of Energy. In Yoga’s terminology, Energy unites with Consciousness.Therefore, Shri Ram represents Consciousness. 
In this way, we will corelate several characters and events from Valmiki Ramayana to complex Yoga processes to reveal the gaps in our understanding of Yoga.

1. Common Questions about Yoga and Ramayana
2. New Perspective on Valmiki Ramayana, to indentify layers and patterns within it
3. Inderect References to Seven Chakras in Valmiki Ramayana
4. Review the Events of Final War between Shri Ram (as the Consciousness) and Ravana (as the Ahamkara/ ego) by reading Valmiki Ramayana line-by-line, to see hidden meanings of the events happening in War in terms of Yoga.
