Ramayana explains Yoga concepts and their relationships using a story. The characters represent fundamental concepts of Yoga. For example, Shri Ram represents Consciousness, Sita represents Energy, and Hanumana represents Prana, etc. 
Hanuman is a representation of Prana. We take Prana from the air, and in Ramayana, he is a son of Air god (Vayu). One of the crucial roles of Prana is to find dormant Energy locked up in the Muladhara chakra. In Ramayana, we see that job of Hanuman was to find Sita, who was locked up in Lanka.
In Ramayana, Sita went through fire because she represents Energy, and fire is a form of Energy. In Yoga’s terminology, Energy unites with Consciousness. Therefore, Shri Ram represents Consciousness.
Look at any image or idol of Shri Ram. It is a beautiful depiction of the secret message given to us through Ramayana.
If we find the Energy (Sita), the Consciousness (Shri Ram) will come searching for Energy (Sita), and we will find the Consciousness (Shri Ram).
If we have a Devoted Mind (Lakshmana) on the Consciousness (Shri Ram), it will lead us directly to the Consciousness (Shri Ram).
Optionally, we can find the Prana (Hanumana), by doing Pranayama. The Prana (Hanuman) will find the Energy (Sita) in Muladhara Chakra (Lanka), and we will then find the Energy (Sita) within our body. When the Consciousness (Shri Ram) comes down to find the Energy (Sita), it (He) will reveal itself (Himself) to us automatically.
