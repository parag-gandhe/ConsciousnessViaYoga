PREFACE 


Several years ago, I translated the Saihkhya 
Karikas and then the Brahma-Sutras into Assamese. 

Indian Philosophy I never did profess to know. 
Nevertheless I translated those books because they had 
not been translated into Assamese so long. Later on, 
with a view to add to my humble contribution to my 
mother language, I translated the Gita and wrote some 
other booklets on allied subjects. 

In all those books I tried to explain my points by 
citing illustrations from modern physical science. It is 
no doubt unorthodox to try to understand spiritual 
truths with a materialistic outlook, but my attempt was 
perhaps not entirely unsuccessful, for the Bhavan’s Journal 
(15th Dec., 1957) reviewing one of my booklets, translated 
into Hindi by my daughter-in-law, wrote as follows : 

*‘The Hindi version of the above book by Shri 
Radhanath Phukhan, m.a., b, l., Vedanta Vacaspati, is 
a very valuable piece of literature. The book was 
originally written in Assamese. The author has success- 
fully tried to explain to the layman the highly philo- 
sophical and moral ideas of the Upanisads. Fine 
commentaries at the end of each story which are the 
result of deep study of Western thinkers like Eddington 
and others add much to the value of the book.” 

Some little time ago, a friend of mine, Dr. Ajit- 
ranjan Bhattacharji of the Calcutta University, insisted 
that these books should be translated into English so 
that the new method of treatment may receive wider 
publicity. 

Another friend of mine, Shri Sailendra Nath Sen- 
Gupta, Judge of the City Civil Court, Calcutta, under- 
took to translate these books, and he actually translated 
Parts I, II and III of the Introduction to the S^khya 



( Vi ) 

Darsana. He did so out of kindness to me and I shall 
ever remain grateful to him. 

At this stage, it was suggested to me that the 
Assamese books having been meant for laymen with or 
without any scientific or philosophical background were 
somewhat verbose and even contained some repetitions. 
The present English translation is meant for another 
purpose and for another class of readers. Here, as it 
were, I have framed an issue and am submitting it to 
a court of learned Pandits for a decision. The issue is : 

(1) Whether the Saihkhya Philosophy is atheistic 
and without a clear meaning ; or 

(2) whether it is a precisely scientific treatise on 
‘Tsycho-Physics for God-realization”. 

Accordingly, I have made this book as brief as I 
could. It has become practically a new rendering of 
the Saihkhya Karikas and not a mere translation from 
Assamese. 

I am particularly grateful to Dr. Mahamahopadhyaya 
Gopinath Kaviraj m.a., d. utt., of Varanasi, who 
received me very kindly and took the trouble of going 
through the type-script copy of the book. He has now 
returned it to me with some kind words which I am 
publishing below as a foreword from such a high 
authority. 

Lastly, I have great pleasure in acknowledging the 
valuable assistance rendered to me by my cousin R. R. 
Khaund in all matters connected with the publication 
of this book. I am also indebted to Shri Amalendu Sen, 
Advocate, Calcutta, who has helped in revising the script 
and reading the proofs.

FOREWORD 


I have glanced through the pages of an Ms. of Shri 
Radhanath Phukan’s work on Samkhya Darsan. It is 
an English translation of Isvara Krsna’s Saihkya Karikas 
with Introduction and notes in English. In the Intro- 
duction he has dealt with the fundamentals of Samkhya 
Philosophy and Psychology, and in this study his knowledge 
of the implications of modern physical science has been 
made to throw helpful light. 

Though there have been several English renderings 
of these Karikas, the present translation has a value of 
its own and will, I hope, be properly appreciated by 
those for whom it is intended.

INTRODUCTION 


Part I — Revolution in Western Science 


( 1 ) 

There is no important difference between 
the Sarhkhya and the Vedanta Philosophy ; 
what difference there is, is in the angle of vision. 
In Vedanta, the world is seen from the outside 
with a subtle philosophical mind ; hence in 
order to understand the reasoning of the Vedanta, 
it requires a minimum intellectual capacity. 

In Sarhkhya, on the other hand, the world 
is seen broadly from the worldly point of view, 
it takes one gradually to matters more and more 
subtle and ultimately leads him to a stage from 
which he may easily realize all the fundamentals. 

The method of analysis is the same in the 
Sarhkhya as in the modern science. In science 
also gross matter is taken up first for analysis 
which is carried ultimately to such a subtle 
stage that one may doubt whether the universe 
is at all real. The Relativity and the Quantum 
theories lend support to the conclusions of the 
Sarhkhya Philosophy and to one who is 
conversant with these theories, a proper under- 
standing of the Sarhkhya Philosophy would be 



2 


Samkhya Karika of Ismrakrsna 


quite easy. For this reason, I shall discuss 
very briefly one or two important matters dealt 
with by Western Science which may help us 
in understanding the underlying principles of 
the Samkhya theory of creation. This discussion 
may be skipped over by those readers who 
may be familiar with the Relativity theory and 
the Quantum mechanics. 

( 2 ) 

About 1900 A.D. scientists were of the view 
that the Universe was like a big machine. 
From dust particles right up to the planets 
and the stars, everything material was held 
to be regulated by the natural laws, most of 
which had already been discovered by science. 
It was thought that a man could become 
omniscient and all-powerful, if he could somehow 
fully grasp all these laws. 

The world was taken by surprise when the 
materialistic science discovered complicated 
machines like the aeroplane, the radio and the 
cinema. The result was an infinite faith in 
science, so much so, that one was prepared to 
hold that even one’s own soul had no existence 
because its existence could not be demonstrated 
by scientific experiment. Men became indifferent 
to God, because it was felt that the world 



Introduction 


3 


would go on as before according to the natural 
laws discovered by scientists, whether God really 
existed or not. 

It is not that the scientists at this time 
were all unbelievers ; as a matter of fact most 
of them were by nature religious-minded and 
God-fearing. But they found it difficult to 
reconcile their religious belief with their convic- 
tions as scientists. Thus Eddington states, “In 
the last century and also in this there must 
have been many scientific men who kept their 
science and religion in water-tight compartments. 
One set of beliefs held good in the laboratory 
and another set of beliefs in church, and no 
serious effort was made to harmonize them. . . - 
Religion first became possible for a reasonable 
scientific man about the year 1927.” (Eddington : 
The Nature of the Physical World, p. 3) 

I think it is for this reason that, in 1893, 
Madame Blavatsky forecasted that soon the 
materialistic science would receive a death-blow. 
This is what she actually stated : “It is at the 
close of great cycles that such events generally take 
place. We are at the very close of the cycle of 
5,000 years of the present Aryan Kaliyuga, and 
between this time and 1897 there will be a 
large rent in the veil of Nature and materialistic 
science will receive a death-blow.” {Secret 
Doctrine, Vol. I, p. 671) 



4 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


Her prognosis was fulfilled almost literally, 
for a revolution in the world of science commenced 
from 1904. This revolution is still proceeding. 
But now the Western Science is no longer 
materialistic, and is actually idealistic. On this 
point it would be interesting to see what Sir 
James Jeans says : 

“The law and order which we find in the 
Universe are most easily described — and also, 
I think, most easily explained in the language 
of idealism. Thus, subject to the reservation 
already mentioned, we may say that present- 
day science is favourable to idealism. In brief, 
idealism has always maintained that, as the 
beginning of the road by which we explore 
nature is mental, the chances are that the end 
also will be mental. To this the present-day 
science adds that, at the farthest point she has 
so far reached, much, and possibly all, that 
was not mental, has disappeared and nothing 
new has come in that is not mental. Yet, who 
shall say what we may find awaiting us at the 
next corner ?” {New Background of Science, p. 307) 

The present view of science is, to quote 
Eddington, that “The purely objective sources 
of the objective element in our observational 
knowledge have already been named ; they are 
Life, Consciousness and Spirit. We reach, then, 
the position of idealist as opposed to materialist 



Introduction

philosophy. The purely objective world is the 
spiritual world and the material world is 
subjective in the sense of selective-subjectivism.” 
( The Philosophy of Physical Science, p. 69) 

It would be interesting to discuss what 
led to this wonderful revolution in Western 
Science. 


( 3 ) 

In 1887, an epoch-making experiment was 
conducted by two scientists, Dr. Michelson, an 
American, and Prof. Morley, a German. The 
experiment was repeated by other scientists but 
it is necessary to refer only to the experiment 
repeated by Morley and Miller in 1904. The 
original object of the experiment was to 

ascertain the existence of Ether. The existence 
of Ether could not be demonstrated by the 

experiment but it proved something which was 
at that time not even dreamt of by most 
scientists. \ It proved that if a scale or anything 
having length moves at a tremendous speed, 
speed approaching that of light, then the length 
of the scale will remain constant if it is kept 
always at right angles to the direction of the 

speed, but that it would contract if it is kept 

parallel to the line of the motion. The 
contraction would depend on the velocity and 



6 


SaAikhya Karika of livarakrsna 


the length would be reduced to nothing if the 
velocity equals that of light. The contraction 
is known as the Fitzgerald Contraction which 
can be calculated easily if the velocity is known. 
It would certainly be astounding if the length 
of a yardstick varied with the direction and 
rate of its velocity. It seems most unnatural 
but it is a scientific truth. Eddington says as 
follows : 

“There is really nothing mysterious about 
the Fitzgerald Contraction. It would be an 
unnatural property of a rod pictured in the 
old way as a continuous substance occupying 
space in virtue of its substantiality ; but it is 
an entirely natural property of a swarm of 
particles held in delicate balance of electro- 
magnetic forces, and occupying space by buffeting 
away anything that tries to enter. The Fitzgerald 
Contraction is not an imperfection but a fixed 
and characteristic property of matter, like 
inertia.”^ 

It is impossible to ascertain if anything in 
the universe is stationary. It seems, every 

^It will be shown later on in my notes on Karika 
XXXIII that this “Fitzgerald Contraction” appears in 
all our calculations because we calculate Time and 
Space separately instead of regarding them as an 
inseparable unit designated by modern science as “Space- 
Time”.

constituent of the universe is moving at tremen- 
dous speeds. The stars, it has been found, are 
all moving away from us at enormous speeds, 
hundreds of miles per second. 

But a scientist living on the Pole-Star, for 
instance, thinks that the earth is moving at 
1000 miles per second while he himself is 
stationary. In the same way we here think 
that our Earth is stationary while the Pole- 
Star is moving at the rate of 1000 miles a 
second. It is impossible to say to which of 
us the observed relative velocity of 1000 miles 
a second really belongs. 

Let us, however, take it that we are 
stationary and then think how the Fitzgerald 
Contraction has affected all the calculations made 
by us or by the scientist on the Pole-Star. 
One of us must be wrong. 

The constancy of the measuring scale was 
the only thing on which the whole structure 
of classical physics was based. It does not 
matter whether we measure with a yardstick 
or a theodolite or merely judge distances by 
the eye — all methods of measurement will agree 
— and must agree. 

Suppose we have made a survey of the 
world or a portion of it and located the 
surrounding objects in their respective positions 
in space. We, of course, overlook the Fitzgerald 



S SaAikhya Karika of IsvarakTsna 

Contraction, because we are stationary, as we 
think. 

Now, let us see what the scientist on the 
Pole-Star will think of the picture drawn by 
us, if he can see it and compare it with the 
picture he himself has drawn of the same frame 
of space. His scale contracts in one direction, 
as stated above, and consequently all his 
measurements of lengths in that direction will 
be too great. A square on our configuration 

of space will be a rectangle to him. He will, 

no doubt, exclaim : “How unfortunate are those 
people on the Earth ; they cannot have a right 
view of the frame of space in which they live — 
and this is because they are moving at a 
rate of 1000 miles per second ; they must have 
deduced a system of laws of nature which 

must have been vitiated by their wrong 

measurements of lengths in one direction ; how 
unfortunate !” 

It was long known to the scientists that 
the colour of anything moving at a great 
speed changes from blue to green, green to 
red, or the reverse, according to its speed. 
This is known as the “Doppler Effect” applied 
to light. Thus it was known that colour varied 
with motion. But no one could imagine that 
the concept of space, the size or the shape 
of objects, and their distance from one another 



Introduction 


9 


also required modification. The Michelson- 
Morley experiment thus brought about a 
conceptual revolution in the scientific world. 
Alter this famous experiment, everything that 
the scientists supposed about the nature of 
the physical world was found to rest on very 
slender foundations. 

And this was how the classical scheme of 
Physics first came to be questioned. 

The first question that troubled the Physicists 
now was this : “If creatures of different planets 
have different ideas of the frame of space they 
are living in, if they see the world differently, 
what, then, is the true picture of the world ? 
How should it look to a man in a planet 
which is at absolute rest ?” 

Then, in 1911, Lord Rutherford discovered 
that inside the atoms there was nothing but 
mere emptiness. There are, no doubt, electrons 
revolving round a nucleus, but it was found 
that even these consist of electro-magnetic waves 
and nothing else. If that is so, the second 
question which confronted the scientists was, 
“How is it that we all see around us objects 
of various shapes and colour ?” 

It was Einstein who found the solution to 
the first question in 1915 when he announced 
to the world his General Theory of Relativity. 
He demonstrated that since everything in 



10 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakfsna 


this material universe, from the humblest speck 
of dust to the mighty stars and nebulae, is 
moving in the space at tremendous speeds and 
because space and time are relative, there can 
be no absolute measure of length or time. 
Everyone thinks that he is stationary while 
everybody else is moving. He thinks that 
what he sees is the real picture of the Universe 
and that what others see is erroneous. In 
truth, however, stability, length, shape and even 
colour which depends on wave-lengths, are all 
relative. How the Universe would appear to 
a person depends upon his position in the 
Universe and his velocity. It follows that it 
is impossible for anyone to know the real nature 
of the Universe. 


( 4 ) 

Einstein proved not only that the shape 
and size of the external Universe are relative ; 
he also proved that our concept of time is 
relative depending, as it does, upon the velocity 
of the observer in space.' ■ This can be easily 
understood by anyone who is conversant with 
advanced mathematics. 

From our knowledge of elementary geography 
we know that if a man takes his lunch in an 
aeroplane at noon and travels from east to west 



Introduction 


11 


with a velocity of about 1000 miles an hour,, 
time will appear to him to stand still. It will 
always be noon for him. Similarly, though 
not exactly for the same reason, if a man 
travels through the empty space of the Universe 
with a velocily of about 1,86,000 miles per 
second, which is the velocity of light in empty 
space, time for him will stand still. Let us 
suppose there are two friends, one of whom 
travels in space with a velocity equal to that 
of light. When he returns to the Earth after 
his sojourn, he will find that his friend has 
added to his years but he still retains his 
original age. Thus, the two men have not lived 
the same time between their two meetings. This 
paradox may be verified mathematically but it 
is not yet possible to verify it experimentally. 

On this point Eddington says : “Although 
we cannot try the experiment of sending a man 
to another part of the Universe, we have 
enough scientific knowledge to compute the 
rates of atomic and other physical processes 
in a body at rest and a body travelling rapidly. 
We can say definitely that the bodily processes 
in the traveller occur more slowly than the 
corresponding processes in the man at rest 
{i.e.t more slowly according to the Astronomer 
Royal’s time). This is not particularly mysterious. 
It is well known both from theory and experiment 



12 


Samkhya Karika of livarakrsna 


that the mass or inertia of matter increases 
when the velocity increases. The retardation 
is a natural consequence of the greater inertia. 
Thus, so far as the bodily processes are 
concerned, the fast-moving traveller lives more 
slowly.* His cycle of digestion and fatigue ; 
the rate of his muscular response to stimulus ; the 
development of his body from youth to 
age ; the material processes in his brain which 
must more or less keep step with the passage of 
thoughts and emotions ; the watch which ticks 
in his waistcoat pocket ; — all these must be 
slowed down in the same ratio. If the speed 
of travel is very great we may find that, whilst 
the stay-at-home individual has aged 70 years, 
the traveller has aged only one year. He has 
only found appetite for 365 breakfasts, lunches 
etc. ; his intellect, clogged by a slow-moving 
brain, has only traversed the amount of thought 
appropriate to one year of terrestrial life. His 
watch which gives a more accurate and 
scientific reckoning confirms this. Judging by 
the time which consciousness attempts to 
measure after its own rough fashion — and I 
repeat, this is the only reckoning of time which 
we have a right to expect to be distinct from 
space — the two men have not lived the same 
time between the two meetings.” {The Nature 
af the Physical World) 



Introduction 


IS 

Thus, if anyone finds it possible to move 
in empty space with the velocity of light, he 
may retain his youth for ever like the ancient 
sages, Sanaka and Sananda. 

In the Visnupurana, we read the story of 
princess Revati, who lived in the Satyayuga. 
When she grew up, her father went up to 
heaven to consult his friend Brahma about her 
marriage. Brahma said to him, “In course of 
the few moments you have been here, Satyayuga 
as well as Tretayuga have passed away in the 
world where you live, and the Dvaparayuga 
also is about to come to an end. So you go 
back to the earth immediately and give your 
daughter in marriage to Balarama, brother 
of Sri Krsna.” Fortunately Revati had accom- 
panied her father to heaven and so her age 
did not increase. In the Puranas there are many 
such stories. We learnt in our childhood that 
a day of the gods is equal to a human year. 

It is quite likely that some of the readers 
will say that these are merely tales and not the 
truth. But it seems that the sages who thought 
out such stories had a clear idea about the 
truth regarding space and time. They knew 
quite well that the measure of time was not the 
same everywhere. But this truth we do not 
realize easily because we have many erroneous 
ideas about space and time. 



14 


Samkhya Karika of Iharakfsna 


Let us take the case of a man born both 
deaf and dumb. Can we say that he has no 
idea about time ? No ; he certainly has the 
same idea about time as we have, but being 
deaf and dumb he is not able to express his 
ideas to another. He would not know anything 
about measure of time like hours and minutes. 
All that he would be able to say, if he could 
speak, is ‘this is the time for this’ or ‘this is 
the time for that’. 

What we call “Time” is really a measure 
of time. Strictly speaking, the real time is one 
and indivisible. The concept of endless time 
is the same as the concept of our own existence. 
“I exist” means that I am always living in 
endless time. The English scientists call this 
concept ‘becoming’ or ‘time lived’. This is the 
real Time. But we have seen that it is actually 
relative, — its length, like spatial length, depends 
on velocity. 

This concept of ‘relative’ time is an entirely 
personal matter. It is not realized like other 
concepts from the external world through the 
senses. The concept will remain even if the 
entire external world, including all external 
events and all external matters, becomes 
annihilated. It cannot be expressed or communica- 
ted to others. This relative or real time has 
thus no connection with “Space”. In practical 



Introduction 


15 


life, however, this realization of the concept 
of (relative) time, which is the only real time 
we know, has to be indicated to others at every 
moment, for otherwise it would not be possible 
for one to continue as a social being. When 
I see a piece of cloth, I can at once infer its 
length and, so far as I am concerned, it is not 
necessary to measure the length at all. But if 
I have to express my estimate of its length, 
I have to adopt a unit of measurement, yard 
or cubit, which is understood by others. In 
the same manner, if I have to express to another 
person my concept of my relative time, I have 
to adopt a unit, by a reference to an external 
event. This means that I have now to mix 
up time (relative time) with space. In order 
to do so, two things are necessary : (1) I myself 
and that person must live at about the same 
space in the universe, or else, our concepts of 
relative time will not be the same ; (2) the 
external events mentioned above must be such 
as may be seen by both of us at the same time. 

It is on the basis of these assumptions 
that I can explain to others living in the 
same world as myself my concept of time in 
terms of, say, hours and minutes. These hours 
and minutes are units adopted for the sake of 
convenience only. But such units, or measurement 
of time by means of such units, would be valid 



16 


SaHildiya Karika of livarak^m 


for my world only. It is only a makeshift 
measurement of time. But in itself it is not 
relative, because it is identical for everyone 
of us in this world, since I have adopted a 
unit on the basis of external events, like sun- 
rise or sun-set, perceived by everyone of us. 
This is the time of our everyday use, a mixture 
of relative time with space. It is called by the 
scientists “Astronomical Time” in order to 
distinguish it from Einstein’s Relative Time. 
( I will show in Karika XXXIII that according 
to Samkhya also this astronomical time is no 
time at all. ) 

Now, consider how we can explain this: 
makeshift measurement of the time-interval to 
a person living in a different world. If I may 
say so, there is no way whatsoever for doing so^ 
because : (1) his concept of relative time does 
not coincide with mine, and (2) there can be no 
external event which can be perceived by both 
of us at the same time. The event which I 
can see now was seen by the denizens of another 
world perhaps thousands of millions of years 
ago, or it may be that it will be perceived by 
them thousands of millions of years hence. 
This is so because light has a velocity and so 
takes time to traverse vast distances. Thus the 
inhabitants of a star, millions and millions of 
miles away, will see an event which took place

17 


recently in this world, such as the explosion of the 
atom bomb at Hiroshima, many many years 
hereafter. So if there is an explosion in the star 
RohinI (Aldebaran), we shall see it many 
years thereafter. It follows that the division 
of time into present, past and future would not be 
identical in all the worlds. 

Later on we shall see that there is no 
‘difference between the Samkhya Philosophy 
and modern science regarding the nature of 
time. 


( 5 ) 

I referred to Lord Rutherford before. In 
the Court of Scientists, Lord Rutherford, rather 
than Einstein, would be held responsible for 
the far-reaching revolution in science which 
has been proceeding for the last 40 years or 
more. It was Lord Rutherford who proved 
the fundamental principle of the Samkhya 
philosophy that there is nothing real in this 
world except Energy in the form of electricity. 

The entire scientific world in Europe was 
stunned by this discovery. But at the same 
time this discovery has enhanced the prestige 
of the Samkhya philosophy. Lord Rutherford 
found by experimentally smashing the atom 
that it consists of empty space full of electrical 
2 



18 


Saihkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


energy. Inside the atom there is a nucleus, 
round which revolve some electrons which are 
merely negative charges of electricity. The 
nucleus itself consists of Protons, which are 
positive charges of electricity, and some Electrons 
(except in the case of hydrogen, an atom of 
which consists of one proton and one electron 
only). Thus, a number of protons and a lesser 
number of electrons arc cemented together to* 
form the nucleus. The total number of protons 
in an atom must be equal to the number of 
electrons (both revolving and cemented) in it. 
It follows that in the Universe there are as 
many protons as electrons. It has been calculated 
that the total of each is of the order 10”. 

The atom is like the Solar System, the 
nucleus corresponding to the sun and the 
revolving electrons to the planets. It is by 
the number of rotating electrons in an atom 
that the chemists identify elements. The total 
number of electrons in an atom determines 
the chemical as well as the physical properties 
of the element. To all intents and purposes, 
the nucleus of an atom is inert. The source 
of activity in an atom is the electron alone. 
In the Universe, all activity and all sorts of 
transformations are due to the activity of the 
electrons. There cannot be a smaller or subtler 
particle of energy than an electron, p

The Quantum Theory is now in the making. 
Scientists are now making endless researches 
about it. But we are not concerned with these 
researches ; because whatever further view is in 
prospect, the experimental fact will always 
remain the same — viz. that energy in the form 
of electric charges are the only ingredients of 
the physical universe. Scientific theories are 
always changing ; The wave theory of light 
replaced the corpuscular theory, heat was 
changed from substance (calorie) to energy of 
motion, electricity was changed from fluid to 
nuclei of strain in Ether and so forth. But 
all these changes of views were based on 
experimental facts which are unalterable. A 
scientific theory is like a solution of a cross- 
word puzzle. It must fit in with the experimental 
facts which are unalterable and are true for 
all time, just as a solution of a cross-word puzzle 
must fit in with the words given as unalterable. 
Even if the scheme of physics which Einstein, 
Bohr, Rutherford and a galaxy of other eminent 
scientists are building up, even if this scheme 
is doomed to be replaced by a better one 
within the next fifty years, even then, the 
experimental fact will remain that matter is 
nothing but electrons and protons — mere electric 
charges. It is unthinkable that science can ever 
revert to the old idea of a substance in the atom.

SaMhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


This is all we want for our present purpose of 
studying the Samkhya Philosophy. 

( 6 ) 

If we think of the Universe as a whole, 
we readily see that it is ceaselessly undergoing 
transformation, and till the end of the creation 
this transformation will go on. There is not a 
moment when the Universe docs not suffer any 
change. But this transformation is not merely 
a pointless one. The Universe is, according to 
scientists, heading towards disorganization from 
an organized state. There will come a time 
after which there will be no transformation 
or change of any sort. Everything will ultimately 
be transformed into pure energy. There is no 
power known which can stop this headlong 
progress towards complete disorganization. A 
green plantain ripens with time, but it is 
not possible by any means to make a ripe 
plantain green again. Just as time proceeds 
ceaselessly from past to future, so also the 
movement of energy is ceaseless towards the 
accomplishment of its predestined object. 
Energy can only move forward and never 
backward. With time. Entropy increases, never 
does it decrease. This is the famous Second 
Law of Thermo-dynamics. Entropy corres-

ponds to change from organized state towards 
disorganization. 

So also the Samkhya Philosophy says that 
there is no end to the transformation of the 
Gunas and that the said transformation has an 
object. 

ilt is obvious that such transformation of 
the Gunas, or what is the same thing as increase 
of entropy, cannot continue indefinitely. Just 
as there is a limit to tearing a piece of paper 
into shreds, so also there is a limit to the 

transformation of universal energy, that is, 

increase of entropy. This final state is, in the 
words of modern science, a state of “Thermo- 
dynamic Equilibrium”. This is nothing but 
the Final Destruction of the Universe, the 
Mahapralaya of our Sastra. At this state there 
is no past, present or future, no active energy, 
no light, heat or anything. It is conceived 
that after this there will be an infusion of 

energy leading to a fresh creation. This is 

practically what is suggested by the Science of 
Thermo-dynamics. 

This is also what has been stated in our 
religious books about creation and destruction 
of the Universe. 

The Second Law of Thermo-dynamics is so 
firmly established that no scientist can ever doubt 
its truth. 



22 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


Eddington accepts this position, but has 
stated it very cautiously and in a roundabout 
manner : 

“Scientists and theologians alike must regard 
as somewhat crude the n^ive theological doctrine 
which, suitably disguised, is at present to be 
found in every text book of thermo-dynamics, 
namely, that some billions of years ago, God 
wound up the material universe, and has left it 
to change ever since.... It is one of those 
conclusions from which we can see no logical 
escape. . .only it suffers from the drawback that 
it is incredible.” {The Nature of the Physical World, 
p. 90) Then again “...the present course 
will repeat itself many times over — an infinite 
number of times in fact — before ‘t’ reaches 
infinity. Don’t ask me whether I really believe 
or expect you to believe that this will happen. 
Logic is logic. That’s all I say.” {New Pathways 
in Science, p. 62)^ 

This is also the teaching of the Samkhya 
Philosophy, viz. that creation is cyclic. 


^ Sir Arthur I'iddiagton, as one of the greatest 
scientists of the world, cannot but say so. He cannot go 
beyond the scientific method of investigation. There can 
be no scientific investigation on the assumption that God 
exists and does everything by miracles.

It is the conclusion of modern science, based 
on numerous experiments, that in the Universe 
there is nothing real except waves of electrical 
energy. Thus says Eddington, “It is pertinent 
to remember that the concept of substance has 
disappeared from fundamental physics. What 
we have ultimately come down to is a form — 
waves ! waves !! waves !!! Or, for a change, if we 
we come down to the Relativity Theory, a 
curvature of space-time, and in Quantum Theory, 
a periodicity of waves.” {Philosoplty of Physical 
Science, p. 110) 

In the words of Sir James Jeans, “The 
electric and magnetic forces are mental con- 
structs of our own, resulting from our misguided 
efforts to understand the motions of the 
particles.” {Physics and Philosophy, p. 200) 

Thus in Modern Science, solid matter has 
successively been reduced to empty atoms, then 
electrical particles, then electro-magnetic waves, 
which ultimately are shown to be forms of 
energy, and, in the last resort, to be mere ideas ! 

Let us, however, assume that the Universe 
is a form of energy and that energy has an 
objective existence. The question that next 
arises is how then do we see so many solid 
objects of various shapes. On this point the 



24 


Sanikhja Karika 0/ Isvarakfsm 


reader is referred to Verses nos. XVI and XXXIV 
of the text, or to Eddington’s Mew Pathways in 
Science. According to the Relativity Theory, no 
one can ever know what the Universe is really like. 
Matter itself is, according to Modern Science, 
unobservable. Matter is only a sum-total of 
electric energy which affects our senses and 
produces a sensation in our brain. But science 
is unable to elucidate the matter any further. 
External to ourselves there is only Energy and 
inside only the Mind. The external energy in 
the form of waves strikes our eyes and other 
organs of senses and then our mind feels some- 
thing. This is the only relation we have with 
the external world. It is (to quote Eddington) 
as if I am living inside a fort besieged by 
enemies, and of all that is happening outside, 
I get the news only by receiving some signals. 
These signals, which correspond to electric 
waves, are like so many cipher codes which my 
mind deciphers, and gives them shape, colour, 
taste and so on, which thereafter become the 
subject-matter of my knowledge. I feel not 
matter, but about matter. At the same time 
I know that the waves of energy which 
produce such feeling have themselves neither 
shape nor substance, colour, or any other 
sensory characteristic. What I feel about matter 
is only a creation of my mind. Cinema, Radio

and Television — these three modern discoveries 
also demonstrate that our knowledge about 
matter might be entirely due to transformation 
of electrical energy. 

An uneducated man (to quote Eddington 
again) sometimes makes the mistake that the 
telegrams we receive contain writings by the 
hand of the person sending the message. We 
are making similar mistakes every moment. 
We think that shape, substance, taste and smell 
are all adherent to matter. But in reality, 
there is nothing besides electro-magnetic waves 
of different wave-lengths. Shape, mass, taste 
and smell do not adhere to these waves. We 
think (very wrongly) that a sweet taste adheres 
to an orange. Why then not say that the 
sense of pain also adheres to the needle with 
which the doctor puts some injection in the 
arm ? 

Speaking of taste, colour, smell etc., we use 
these words in two different senses. In the 
first place, we mean the feelings underlying 
these sensations. In the second place, we mean 
the energy which incites these sensations. The 
first is a product of my mind, and the second 
is outside me in the form of energy. Hence, 
outside my mind, if there is anything real in 
the Universe, it is only energy in some form 
or another. Modern science thus practically

confirms tlie conclusion arrived al by the 
Sarhkhya Philosophy. 

Part II : Two Fundamental Considerations in 
Understanding the Samkhya Philosophy 

According to the Samkhya system, there 
arc in all three categories of objects (Padartha),; 
namely, the V yakta (Manifest),V^^the Avyakta 
(Unmanifest) and. the Purusa (the Soul). The 
Purusa is, however, included in the Avyakta^. 

Hence ultimately we have only two categories, 
namely, the Vyakta and the Avyakta. 

The Vyakta comprises the entire Universe, 
everything contained in it, whether it is perceived 
or only inferred. The Avyakta in the Sarhkhya 
Philosophy indicates the Ultimate Cause which 


^ According to Vacaspati, we may describe the 
Purusa as having the characteristics of the Vyakta though 
it is itself Avyakta. The Purusa, that is the individual 
soul, is the seer, but is without attributes or activity 
and is conscious. According to Verse no. X, the individual 
souls would, therefore, be Avyakta, but because they are 
many, they would have the characteristics of the Vyakta 
as well. Prakrti is Avyakta when she is inactive, that 
is, when the Gunas are in equilibrium, but when the 
gunas arc differentiated, she is active and hence Vyakta. 

It will be easy to understand the Sarhkhya Philosophy 
if by Vyakta and Avyakta we mean the manifested and 
the unmanifested states respectively. 



Introduction 


27 


itself has no cause, the causa causans. The 

adherents of the Sarhkhya system hold that 

there can be no effect without cause. There 

must be a cause behind the Vyakta, and 

evidently this cause will have another, and the 
second cause will have a third one, and so 
on. But there must be an ultimate cause which 
itself is uncaused, otherwise there would be 
no end of the chain of causal relation. The 
Avyakta is thus the ultimate cause of the crea- 
tion (Karika XV). Samkhya’s Avyakta thus 
corresponds to Brahman of the Vedanta {vide 
Gaudapada on Verse no. XXII). 

Hence Avyakta is Cause, while Vyakta is 
the Effect. Again, Avyakta is without cause 
(Ahetumat), and Vyakta caused (Hetumat). 

By reasonable inference, it follows that 
whatever is without cause must be infinite, 
endless, indivisible, one, inconceivable, inactive, 
and immanent in everything else. It cannot 
be otherwise. This is what has been indicated 
in Verse no. X. For similar reasons, it will 
be seen that whatever is caused must have 
characters opposite to those of the Avyakta 
and that it must be included in and pervaded 
by the Avyakta. Its existence itself would be 
dependent on Avyakta. This antithesis between 
, cause and effect has been explained in Karika 
XIV to which I shall presently refer. 



28 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


An effect always remains latent in its 
cause and in proper time it is revealed by 
the activity of the Cosmic power. This separation 
of the effect from the cause in which it was 
latent is called creation (Sarga) in the Saihkhya 
philosophy. The Cosmic power or the primeval 
energy with its three modes of action which 
brings about this separation is called the 
Prakrti. 

The activity of the Gunas, that is, their 
transformation, has no respite. Just as a clock 
when set in motion goes on by itself, so also 
once the Gunas commence to act, they continue 
to do so indefinitely according to fixed laws 
until the final object is reached. In the Samkhya 
philosophy, twenty-three separate stages of such 
transformation have been described, so that the 
process of the transformation may be properly 
understood. These stages are Mahat-tattva, 
Ahaihkara-tattva etc. {vide Verse no. III). 

As soon as the Gunas* are in action, i.e., 
as soon as creation begins, along with the 
Prakrti, Purusas (or rather the Purusa) also 
become manifest. At the earliest stage, the 

^ It is stated in Verse no. XI that the activity of 
the Primeval Energy, is three-fold — three Gunas, Sattva, 
Rajas and Tamas. Activity is the same thing as the 
three well-known “Modes of action of Nature” (Newton’s • 
Three Laws of Motion). 



Introduction 


29 


Purusa is in a state which may be described 
as" a trance or stupefaction. The Purusa is 
stupefied, as it were, by the wiles of Prakrti, 
in the words of Gaudapada on Verse no. XL. 
At this stage, the Purusa remains latent in the 
'iPrakrti. Strictly speaking, there is no sense 
in saying that the Purusa remains latent in 
the Prakrti, but I am forced to use this 
expression for want of a better one. At this 
stage in the process of creation there was 
neither time nor space, and so how can 
we think of two different things existing 
independently at that stage ? The concept of 
individuality is dependent on the concept of 
f space. We are unable to think or express 
■ ourselves without recourse to the concepts of 
I; time and space. For this reason I was compelled 
^ to say that the Purusas (Purusas in the aggregate) 
were then latent in the Prakrti. At the same 
time it is not correct to refer to Purusas in 
the plural. There can be no idea of separateness 
i or plurality in the absence of the concept of 
\ space. The mind in the absence of the 
concept of space cannot comprehend distinction. 
No human language can express this pre- 
Greation stage of the Universe. The individual 
souls (Purusas) are n ot separate or distinct 
from one anothcT^f this stage. Purusas in 
the aggregate and the Prakrti remain in a 



30 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


State of coalescence. This stage is designated 
the Mahat-tattva in the Samkhya Philosophy. 
This is the consciousness of the Collective Ego. 

This is the state of affairs also at the 
stage of the Final Destruction of the Universe. 
The Mahat-tattva of the Samkhya has been 
termed Hiranyagarbha and Virat-purusa in the 
Puranas. 

The Samkhya philosophers have no objec- 
tion to the terms Hiranyagarbha and Virat- 
purusa. All that they insist on is that just 
before creation everything in the Universe, 
animate or inanimate, is in the Mahat-tattva 
in an inchoate state, collectively, without any 
sort of individuality. On creation, all these 
become manifest in different forms. This 
receives confirmation in modern science also. 
Thus Jeans says in his Physics and Philosophy, 
p. 204 : 

“The new quantum mechanics may perhaps 
give a hint. In each case space and time are 
inhabited by different individuals ; but when 
we pass beyond space and time, — from the 
world of phenomena to reality, — individuality 

is replaced by community So it may be with 

Life. The phenomena may be individuals 
carrying on separate existence in space and 
time, while in the deeper reality beyond space 
and time, we may all be members of one body.” 



Introduction 


31 


This statement of Jeans cannot be lightly 
brushed aside. What he has stated can be 
appreciated if we keep in mind the findings 
of Wave-Mechanics. Eddington in his Philosophy 
of Pfysical Sciencey Chapter X, has briefly 
indicated the arguments. (Compare in this 
connection the Gita, VIII, 18.) 

The stage ‘subsequent’ to the Mahat-tattva 
is termed Ahamkara-tattva in Sarhkhya philo- 
sophy. The word ‘subsequent’ no doubt implies 
an idea of time which was non-existent at this 
stage, but there is no way out. At this stage 
we have for the first time the idea of indivi- 
duality in Purusas who were so far, as it were, 
in a trance in the Prakrti. An idea of separate 
individual existence succeeds the Collective 
Ego. This idea of individuality is at the root 
of the concepts of Space and Time. ‘I am an 
individual (Purusa)’ implies two concepts, 
namely, (1) first, that ‘I am’, i.e., ‘I always 
exist’ — this leads to the concept of Time ; and 
(2) secondly, ‘I am difierent from others’ — 
which leads to the concept of Space. 

Necessarily, the idea that ‘I am different’ 
leads to the consciousness of the existence of 
other purusas. Clearly, concept of Space means 
an idea of externality. There can be no concept 
of Space in the absence of an external object. 
{vide Paheadasi, 2, 42-45). But this is not a 



32 


Saihkhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


tenet of our sastras alone. It is the conclusion of 
the modern Relativity Theory also. Thus, Jeans ? 
says, ‘For Einstein, Space cannot exist without 
objects' ‘You cannot have space without things 
or things without space.’ (Whitehead) When 
the Jiva or the Individual Soul is in the &lt; 
Ahaihkara-tattva, the concepts of both Time 
and Space arise. These two concepts are 
at the root of all knowledge. Without the 
underlying concept of Space and Time, it is 
not possible to understand anything, to 
think, or speak of anything. At the same 
time, it is not possible to separate the concept 
of Time from that of Space. One is a part 
of the other and includes it. (See notes on 
Karika XXXIII.) 

The next stage of Creation is dichotomous. 
On the one hand, from the Ahaihkara-tattva 
evolves the Sense-Organs (Indriyas) and the Mind 
(Antahkarana), and on the other hand, the 
Tanmatras. That is to say, at this stage of 
creation, the energy of the three Gunas of 
Prakrti bifurcates into two forms, one very 
subtle and the other gross. The subtler energy 
creates the sense-world (Bhavakhya sargah). The 
gross energy, which has been called here the 
Tanmatras, constitutes the entire physical 
universe which Saihkhya calls Liihgakhya or 
Tanmatra sargah {vide Karika LII). 



Introduction 


33 


The Puranas say that energy in the form 
of Tanmatras evolved from the ego-sense of 
the Virat-Purusa. The idea was no doubt 
taken from the above cosmology of the Saihkhya 
Philosophy. According to Samkhya, therefore, 
thoughts and emotions of the sense-world, and 
gross energy (Tanmatras) of the physical world, 
are in substance one and the same thing, 
having emanated from the same source. They are, 
therefore, mutually convertible. We can convert 
thought into energy or energy into thought, just 
as we can convert light into electricity, and 
vice versa} 

The Tanmatra derives its name from the 
fact that it is the smallest fraction of the 
primordial energy of Prakrti (the Gunas 
collectively).^ 

Thus, according to Sarhkhya, energy acts in 
quanta. 

All material objects we see around us are 
composed of Tanmatras alone. Matter is an 
assemblage of Tanmatras only. 

Matter exists in five states, viz . — 

1. Solid (K§iti) 

2. Liquid (Apah) ’

3. Luminous (Tejas)

5. Space (Aka4a) 

These states are called the five Mahabhutas. 

The same matter may exist in all these 
five states : e.g., a piece of lead is solid at first, 
when heated it becomes liquid, further heated 
it becomes red-hot, further heated it becomes a 
gas and finally it disappears into empty space as 
Tanmatras (electrons). 


Part III : The Samkhya Philosophy is not atheistic. 

The Samkhya Philosophy is a system based 
on reason. But such reason is not transcen- 
dental reason as in the Vedanta. It is just 
common sense. It is with such reason that the 
Samkhya system has thought out the real nature 
of the Universe and of the Soul. The basic 
reasoning of the system is incorporated in Verses 
Nos. X, XI and XIV. In order to understand 
the philosophy of the Samkhya system, we have 
to depend on the reasoning put forward in the 
system itself and not on the dialectics obtaining 
in other systems of philosophy. The Samkhya 
philosophy has been misrepresented by many 
because they failed to keep this fact in view. 

At the very outset, it is important to under- 
stand Verses No. X and XI which deal with 



Introduction 


35 


the difference between the Avyakta and the 
Vyakta, that is, between the Unmanifested and 
the Manifested. I have shown that the Mani- 
fested in the Samkhya Philosophy means the 
entire physical Universe whether it is perceived 
or merely inferred. Whatever is beyond this is 
the Unmanifested, the Avyakta. In the words 
of Science, the Vyakta would mean the Four- 
dimensional Space-Time Continuum or the pheno- 
menal world and everything it contains, and 
Avyakta, the Reality above Space-Time. 

We are to keep in mind that beyond the 
physical universe there is neither Time nor Space. 
Time and Space are inseparably connected with 
matter, which, again, can exist only in Time and 
Space. As pointed out above, the characteristics 
of the Avyakta are just the opposite of those of the 
Vyakta. Why this should be so has been 
discussed in Verse No. XIV. . It is said that 
all this is due to the display of the three Modes 
of action of Nature, viz. the three Gu^as. It 
is the Gunas that make all the distinction 
between a Vyakta and the Avyakta. 

Now, I become conscious of an object only 
when some energy coming from it impinges on 
my sense-organs. This is what is taught by 
modern Science and this also is Samkhya’s own 
psychology (Karika XXVIII). 

Thus, according to Samkhya, objects are 



visible and knowable and are subject-matters of 
our senses only because they can transmit 
energy, without which there will be nothing to 
distinguish them from the Avyakta.* 

We thus find in Karika No. XIV (read with 
Karika No. X) yet another distinction between 
the Vyakta and the Avyakta. Vyakta is active 
(Sakriya) and therefore non-conscious (Acetana), 
being subject-matters of our sensations, while 
the Avyakta is without ‘action’ (Niskriya) and 
therefore not an object to be seen and for the 
reason of that it is the conscious Seer itself. 
The idea is that in this world everything can 
be classified either as the seer or the seen, the 
enjoyer or the enjoyed, manifested or the 
unmanifested, conscious or non-conscious ; so, 
if anything is not the one, it must be the other. 

This then is the distinction drawn by the 
Sarhkhya between the Conscious (Cetana) and 
the Non-conscious (Acetana). This distinction 
is difficult to understand not only for the ordinary 
man but also for the learned. This is only 
natural, because our experience tells us that it 
is only the animate conscious beings which are 


It may be remembered that in modern science objects 
are so many bubbles of “bottled-up energy" (to borrow a term 
from Jeans) floating in empty space, like soap-bubbles in 
the sky.

■M 


active and which can move about. We consider 
only such things as non-conscious which are 
inactive and which cannot move by themselves. 
But our experience is now contradicted by the 
Saihkhya. According to the Samkhya, whatever 
is inactive is conscious and everything which 
is active is non-conscious. But Science now 
supports Sarhkhya because everything in this 
world is in a state of motion due to its inherent 
energy. The Saihkhya propounded and Science 
proved that there is a constant movement inside 
all the atoms constituting the Universe. The 
Gunas are, by their very nature, ever transform- 
ing themselves and there is no cessation of 
this transformation. We also know that what is 
matter is nothing but a three-fold activity of 
energy, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas (or mass, 
momentum and stress) . It is a common experience 
that everything in this world suffers change 
and, ultimately, destruction. How can there 
be any change in the absence of inherent 
activity ? How can there be destruction ? There 
is nothing in this world which is inactive and 
it is not even possible to imagine anything which 
is completely so. 

But beyond the phenomenal world, there 
is no play of energy. Hence it is quite 
possible that in the Avyakta stage there may 
be something inactive but it must be remembered

the Vedas. It would thus follow that the 
conclusions of both these systems arc funda- 
mentally the same. 

My friend Manoranjana Sastri has also 
shown that at first it was held that there was 
no fundamental difference between the Sarnkhya 
and the Vedanta. He writes : “In ancient times, 
the Sarnkhya philosophy and the Vedanta 
formed one system and were interdependent. 
In Narasirnha Svamin’s Samkhya-taru-vasantah, 
a commentary on the Sarnkhya Karika, it was 
shown that there was fundamentally no difference 
between the Sarnkhya and the Vedanta.” 

Later commentators, however, lost sight of 
all these considerations and they identified 
Avyakta with Prakrti. According to these 
commentators, the Prakrti is always unmanifested, 
Avyakta, and always non-conscious. They explain 
Verse XV to mean that the non-conscious 
Prakrti is the ultimate cause of the Universe. 
So they draw the necessary inference that 
because the ultimate cause of the Universe 
is non-conscious, the Sarnkhya philosophy must 
be atheistic. 

Those commentators do not admit that 
the Avyakta cannot but be conscious as has 
been shown earlier. Even if we can conceive 
of a separate existence of the Prakrti at the 
Avyakta stage, even then the said Prakrti must 



40 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


be conscious. In the Tantras, that Prakrti has 
been named the Primeval Prakrti or Mahamaya 
and it has been shown that there is no difference 

/ t 

between Siva and Sakti, and that the two are 
fundamentally identical.* 

Why the commentators explained Verse 
No. XV in this way I cannot comprehend. In 
Verse XXI it has been clearly stated that the 
ultimate cause of the Universe is nckhcr ..the 

^ If Verse X is explained correctly, Prakrti cannot be 
understood as Avyakta, because Avyakta of the Sarhkhya is 
inactive, unchanging, real and causeless. Though Prakrti is 
so before the creation, she is active and always changing 
from the beginning of the creation up to its end. 
Prakrti as such has never been termed Avyakta in the 
Samkhya. In Karika XI, Samkhya has distinctly stated 
that this Prakrti or Pradhana has all the attributes of 
the Vyakta. The word Avyakta occurs in the Karikas 
only five times, namely, in the Verses II, X, XIV, 
XV an3 LVIII. In every place Avyakta means the 
the state before creation, that is, the state when the 
Purusa and the Prakrti are united together in one entity. 

Gaudapada, an Advaitin (monist), was fully conscious 
of this, but still he used the word Prakrti to mean 
the Avyakta in Karika LVIII. But he was careful to 
state that Prakrti, Pradhana, Maya, Avyakta and Brahman, 
all mean the same thing [vide Verse XXI). 

The later commentators did not identify Avyakta 
with the Brahman of the Vedanta. They left out the 
Brahman altogether and identified Prakrti alone with 
the Avyakta. 



Introduction 


41 


Purusa alone nor the Prakrti alone. Creation 
is due to the union of the two. The matter 
is made quite clear by the Gita (Chapter XIV, 8). 
Vacaspati himself states that the union of 
Prakrti and Purusa is without beginning and 
end and that the creation of the Universe is 
due to this union. This state of union is the 
Avyakta stage — in this union it is not possible 
to point out the Purusa or the Prakrti as an 
individual entity. Avyakta evidently refers to 
the state before the creation. Again, in Verse 
III and XVII as well as in Verse XI, it 
has been clearly stated that Avyakta is the 
Purusa. 

Then again, all the commentators agree 
that the Yoga system of Patanjali is theistic. 
But it is well known that as regards creation 
there is no difference whatsoever between the 
the two systems {vide my Vedanta Darsana, 
pp. 114-116). Then, how is it that the 
Samkhya system is considered atheistic while 
the Yoga system is admitted to be theistic ? 
The learned commentators have not given any 
convincing reason. 

In the Patahjala system the word Isvara 
has been used once, but the word has not been 
used in the Samkhya. This is the only difference 
between the two schools. Patanjali merely 
states that if we concentrate our mind on a 



42 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsm 


‘particular person’ (Purusa-visesa) called Isvara, 
our mind would thereby become ‘fixed’. But 
in this philosophy there is nothing to show 
that this ‘particular person’ had anything to do 
with the creation of the Universe. As a matter 
of fact, there could be no Isvara with attributes 
(Saguna) before the creation and none at the 
time of the Final Destruction. 

Saguna Isvara, that is, Isvara with attri- 
butes, is only a Purusa subject to the Maya of 
the Prakrti, like ourselves. The only difference 
is that we are powerless under the influence of 
the Maya, while Isvara is not {vide my Gita, 
second edition, p. 112). 

According to the Vedanta also Qualified 
(Saguna) Isvara had no hand in the matter of 
creation. The entire creation is merely a thought 
of the Unqualified (Nirguna) Brahman. 

Again, it should be noted, that the Samkhya 
uses three words, more or less of identical 
import, viz- — Jna, Puman and Purusa. Jna means 
Atman or Pure Consciousness. According to the 
Samkhya Jna, Puman, Purusa — all mean the 
all-pervading Consciousness, and all are Avyakta 
(unmanifested) . Caudapada, the uncompromising 
monist, at once identified Puman with Brahman 
and Purusa with the Seer, the Jivatman, and 
explained that according to the Sainkhya there 
is no distinction between the Jivatman and the 



Inlf eduction 


43 


Paramatman (Brahman). Other commentators 
have not discussed this important question. 
Had they entered into the question, they would 
have had to face the query — “How can the 
non-conscious Prakrti be the ultimate cause of 
the Universe, if it is admitted that an all- 
pervading Consciousness (Cit-sakti) existed 
everywhere ?" 

There is another point to note. It is not 
clear what the commentators understood by the 
word Guna. 

It is generally admitted that in the manifested 
matter there is nothing besides the three Gunas. 
It is also admitted that the Gunas are the 
only workers of all changes or transformation 
in the world. 

Colebrooke explained the Gunas as the “three 
constituent elements” and, up to the present, 
his explanation has held the field in the 
universities. But what are those constituent 
elements ? 

Samkhya has divided all the constituents 
of the world into 24 categories (the 24 tattvas) 
and there cannot be any other “constituent 
elements” besides these. 

Moreover, now that we know that words 
like ‘elements’, ‘substance’ or ‘matter’ have 
disappeared from modern Physics never again 
to return, it is high time that Golebrooke’s 



44 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


definition of the word Guna should be revised. 
It cannot be accepted without further 
elucidation. 

It has been suggested by some that objects 
being nothing more than an assemblage of their 
primary qualities, the Gunas of the Samkhya 
philosophy must be held to be identical with those 
qualities, viz. pleasure, pain and indifference. 

This idea is also contradicted by modern 
Psychology which has abolished all primary and 
secondary qualities of matter and reduced them 
to mere ideas of the mind as explained in 
Part I of the Introduction. Moreover, it is 
difficult to understand how the qualities which 
have no objective existence, apart from a 
human mind, could be the cause of all the 
changes and transformations in the Physical 
world. 

Samkhya itself says in Karika XXXVIII 
that the Tanmatras {i.e., the smallest divisible 
fractions of the Gunas) give rise to pleasure, 
pain or indifference in a human mind. This 
is quite in accordance with the teachings of 
modern Psychology. Thus it seems to me that 
we have not as yet got any clear idea of the 
meaning in which the word Guna has been 
used in the Samkhya philosophy. The only 
plausible explanation of the term, so far as I 
know, has been given by Sri Aurobindo who 



46 Samkkja Karika of Iharaktsna 

nor Kapila was an atheist ; both were Super- 
theists. 

After bitterly criticizing the Samkhya and 
the Yoga systems, Samkaracarya reaches this 
conclusion : “The Samkhya and the Yoga systems 
are both well-known to be the means of 
realizing the ultimate object of man, that is 
salvation. Samkhya means knowledge and Yoga, 
concentration. Brahman can be realized by 
knowledge and concentration. This is admitted 
by the Upanisads. I must admit those portions 
of the Samkhya and the Yoga which are not 
opposed to the Srutis. The Purusa of the 
Samkhya is Nirguna. I unreservedly accept this. 
I also accept the instructions offered by the 
Yoga regarding Sama, Dama etc.” {vide 
Samkara on Brahmasutra, II, 1, 3). 

But is there anything in the Samkhya 
which is opposed to the Srutis ? Is there any 
real challenge of the Samkhya system in the 
Brahmasutras ? I have answered these questions 
in many places of my Vedanta Darsana. 

The Vedanta does not admit the objectivity 
of the Prakrti. As a matter of fact modern 
science also does not admit the objectivity of 
of Energy. 

Energy, which is identical with the Prakrti, 
of the Samkhya, is, according to modern science, 
only a mental concept. Vedanta says exactly 



Introduction 


47 


the same thing. In Vedanta, the Prakrti of 
the Samkhya has been termed “Anumana”, that 
is what is only inferred. 

In Brahmasutra I, 1, 5, Prakrti is termed 
ASabdam ; this means that there is no mention 
of Prakrti in the Srutis. This is the first 
reference of the Samkhya system in the Brahma- 
sutras. 

The second reference is in Sutras I, 4, 1-12. 
Here all the Upanisads were critically considered 
but nowhere was any reference to the Prakrti 
of the Samkhya found. It is concluded that 
though there is a seeming reference to Prakrti 
of the Samkhya in three places, actually the 
reference was to something else. 

The third reference to the Samkhya system 
is in Sutras II, 1, 1-3. Here also it is stated 
that there is no mention of the Prakrti of the 
Samkhya as a separate identity in any Smrti, 
such as the Manu Samhita. 

The Brahmasutras have referred to the 
Samkhya system for the fourth and the last 
time in II, 2, 1-10. Here the underlying 
reasoning of the Samkhya Philosophy in support 
of its principal tenets have been discussed. 
We find in the Brahmasutras themselves that 
according to the Samkhya the world is a 
creation of Nature and that everything in this 
world happens according to natural laws which 



48 


Saihkhya Karika of livarakrsna 


regulate every detail. The Brahmasutras do 
not raise any objection against this, neither 
is it stated that the reasonings of the Samkhya 
Philosophy are in any manner defective. It 
is only stated there that it is not necessary 
to admit an unreal category like the non- 
conscious Prakrti, for everything in this 
phenomenal world happens as it is ordained 
in the ‘mind’ of the Brahman. 

Everything is verily the Brahman. This is 
enough to explain everything. According to 
the Vedanta itself, the Prakrti of Samkhya is 
the Maya, the quintessence of the incompre- 
hensible power of the Brahman which effects 
the creation. 

All this can be comprehended and this is 
also what the Samkhya propounds. In Karika 
No. LXI it is clearly stated that Prakrti is the 
Phenomenal Cause of the Universe {vide my 
analysis of the Karika). In Karika XLVIII 
it has been distinctly said that to regard Prakrti 
as the ultimate reality is a sort of ignorance 
( Avidya) . 

But to understand all this we have first 
to assume that the Prakrti is real and then 
gradually proceed on the basis of that assump- 
tion. This is the only way in which we can 
discuss the matter scientifically. It is on the basis 
of Newton’s materialistic physics that Einstein

49 


succeeded in raising the structure of his idealistic 
theory. It is only recently that the scientists 
have realized that even Energy has no real 
existence. Mere uttering of the Vedantic 
aphorism that “All is Brahman” will only 
benefit those who have the equipment mentioned 
in the Introduction to the Brahma-Sutra. For 
others, it will only impede their spiritual 
progress. For, as it is said : 

This is so because the human mind is so 
constituted that it cannot comprehend anything 
which does not fit in with his own sense-world, 
viz. with his wordly experience and his pre- 
dispositions. It is for this reason that Philosophy, 
Logic, Mathematics and all the other sciences 
are necessary in order to realize the Ultimate 
Reality of which the Vedanta speaks. But 
Vedanta is not a Philosophy at all : It is a 
super-Philosophy where there is no room for 
any scientific discussion or arguments without 
which the ordinary human mind will not be 
convinced. 

For this reason the Samkhya has strictly 
followed the scientific method of investigation 
and has proceeded on the assumption that 
Prakrti is real — for, without assuming the 
4 



50 


Samkhya Karika of lharaknna 


objectivity of space&gt; time and energy&gt; no 
scientific discussion is possible. 

If the Samkhya philosophy is explained 
on the basis of common sense, there arises no 
difficulty whatsoever. But instead of doing so 
if we proceed on the assumption that the 
Samkhya is atheistic, it would never be possible 
to get at the real intention sought to be 
conveyed by the author. It would lead to 
useless controversy and of such controversy 
there will be no end. 

Part IV : Samkhya*s Idea of Creation. 

“We can reasonably infer”, says Gaudapada 
(Karika VI), “that the Purusa guides Prakrti in 
all her actions, otherwise, she being inanimate 
could not create a World.” 

Later on, quoting from the ancient text 
(Sasti Tantra) he said, 

i.e., Prakrti, only when organized by the intelli- 
gent Purusa can be effective. 

From such statements, however, it will be 
quite wrong for the reader to imagine that all 
acts of Prakrti and all her transformations are, 
according to Samkhya, really the work of God. 
Samkhya does not say so. It actually contradicts 
the idea. 

I do not say that it will be far too wrong 



Introduction 


51 


to suppose that everything is ordained by God 
and that not a leaf can fall against His will. 
I say, on the other hand, that a man who has 
realized this great truth has no need to read 
any philosophy at all ; he has understood all ; 
he has understood that Prakrti is in reality the 
will of God. So says the Vedanta and so says 
the Gita also. 

For such a man who has realized the Self 
the Samkhya philosophy has not been written. 
It has been written for ignorant people with 
a view to lead them step by step from gross 
matters to subtler things until they can under- 
stand what the Soul is. 

Samkhya, therefore, begins with gross 
matters and goes slowly up until it reaches the 
three great Modes of action of Nature. It 
shows how the whole creation is the work of 
Nature — a transformation of the three Gunas 
from a highly organized state to a completely 
disorganized one. Thus its method of treatment 
of the subject, and its conclusions also, are the 
same as those of Modern Science. Here, in its 
philosophy, we find the Quantum Theory, the 
Relativity Theory, the Second Law of Thermo- 
dynamics, the Theory of Space-Time and all 
such things. 

The only thing we do not find is God 
Himself. 



52 


Safnkhya Karika of livarakfSM 


By this, however, the reader is not to infer 
that the Sarhkhya is an atheistic philosophy. 
Its main point is that the Avyakta Brahman 
is Static and is not the doer of any action. 

This idea of creation helps a man in 
the path of God-realization. It makes it easy 
for him to realize (1) that the Soul is inactive 
and is a mere Seer (Karika XIX) ; (2) that 
there is no difference between the Soul and 
the Brahman — both being the same eternal and 
all-pervading Consciousness Itself ; (3) that the 
man is not a doer of his action — the three great 
Modes of action of Prakrti work through him. 
(Karika XIX, or Gita, III, 5) 

Lest we should forget these three great 
truths, so essential for self-realization, Gaudapada 
has been reminding us from time to time that 
nothing in Nature is done by God and that 
all transformations of Prakrti are of her own 
making. (See his notes on Karikas XXXI, 
XXVII and LXI.) 

The crux of the whole philosophy of 
Sariikhya lies in the above cryptic passage 
quoted by Gaudapada from the Sasti Tantra 
which is believed to be the original text from 
which the Karikas of Isvarakrsna derive their 
authority. The clear meaning of this passage, 
as I said above, is that Energy cannot do any 
work unless an intelligent man directs it into 



Introduction 


53 


a proper channel. This is a great scientific truth 
and is a matter of our everyday experience. 
We know that energy not so directed can only 
dissipate itself, and if it can create anything, 
it can create only a chaos but never an 
orderly cosmos. Then again, in his exposition 
of Karika XXVII, Gaudapada has shown how 
the Gunas, when organized, can work like an 
intelligent person with caution and pre-thought. 
Now that we have got so many man-made 
machines which work like intelligent persons, 
e.g.i “the Electric Secretary”, the "Robot 
Soldier”, the “Robot Doctor” and the like, we 
require no further confirmation of what 
Gaudapada says. 

Furthermore, in Karika XLII, it is said 
that Prakrti has a wonderful power to do all 
things by her Vibhuti Yoga. 

Verily, the Vibhuti Yoga of Prakrti means 
that no “action” can be done without appli- 
cation of energy and at the same time there 
is nothing in the world which an intelligent 
man cannot do with properly organized energy. 
This statement requires no verification when we 
consider that by means of properly organized 
energy, even human scientists are now about 
to break earthly bonds and conquer space with 
their rockets. There is every prospect of their 
being able to do more. 



54 


Samkhyo Karika oj Jsvarakrsna 


According to Saihkhya, therefore, this 
universe is a vast organization of the Avyakta 
Brahman, in which every action, every event 
in space-time including our birth, death 
and rebirth, is a continuous natural process 
carried on by Prakrti with her three Gunas, 
and Brahman only devised the organization 
once for all and did nothing more. In its 
discussion in Karika XVII, Samkhya has made 
it •vlear that although the Avyakta Purusa has 
thus completely concealed himself from our view, 
his presence can easily be felt in the inevitable 
law and order that prevail all oi^er the universe. 

This is also Vedanta’s own idea. For, 
according to Vedanta, Brahman is Nirguna 
(static). The universe evolved out of a thought 
of His and all subsequent events in space-time 
are the work of His Maya (Prakrti). 

Thus, one Upanisad actually says that 
though, according to sages who know, the whole, 
creation is an act of Nature, yet its ultimatCji 
cause is Brahman.” (Svetasvatara, VI, 1) •

There it gives our mind the impression of the 
yellow colour and this impression is stored for 
ever in our “sub-conscious mind” as a thought 
of the yellow.^ 

We can recall the thought afterwards to 
our consciousness when we want, or it appears 
by itself to us in our dreams, when it becomes 
a living thought ; otherwise it lies stored in the 
sub-conscious mind with many other such 
thoughts of which we are not aware at all. 

We know no more at present about the 
nature of our thoughts. Recently, however, 
Bio-chemists of America are beginning to make 
extensive researches about the nature of thoughts 
by studying the electric eels which abound in 
that country. These electric eels, it has been 
found, can stun or kill their prey from a 
distance by discharging electricity from their 
bodies. This gives a cue to the scientists for 
discovering how thoughts arise and how impulses 
are translated into action. If the experiment 
proves successful, it may lend support to what 
the ancient thinkers of India said about the 
nature of thoughts thousands of years ago. 

I have said before that according to the 


^ The sub-conscious mind of the new psychology of 
modern science is the same as the ‘‘Saihskara” of Indian 
philosophy. 



56 


Saiiikhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


Sarilkliya Philosophy thoughts and energy are 
only two forms of the same thing. Energy gives 
rise to thoughts and thoughts become energy 
when they come out from the mind. That is 
how Yogis are said to be possessed of power 
to do wonderful things merely by thinking. 
The only difference between thoughts and energy, 
as I said before, is that thoughts are very 
subtle energy {i.c., in modern language, vibrations 
of very high frequencies) which our sense-organs 
cannot receive, while gross energy which strikes 
our sense-organs are vibrations of lower 
frequencies. 

Both being the same energy, it follows 
that their activity must be governed by the 
same laws. 

We know from dynamics that in the physical 
world activity of energy is governed by three 
well known laws to which I referred above 
as Newton’s Three Laws of Motion. In classical 
Physics, they are called ' inertia, ’ acceleration 
and reaction, and in modern Physics, mass 
(or energy), momentum and stress. 

It is difEcult to explain to a layman what 
mass, or momentum, or stress mean, although 
the meaning of the terms is crystal-clear to a 
scientist who knows how Nature works. Samkhya 
has explained how the same three-fold activity 
of Nature exists also in the sense world. 



Introduction 


57 


/ 

Thus says Sri Aurobindo : “The idea of 
the three essential Modes of Nature is a creation 
of the ancient Indian thinkers and its truth 
is not at once obvious because it was the 
result of long psychological experiment and 
profound internal experience .... These Modes 
are termed in Indian books Qualities 
(Gunas), and were given the names — Sattva, 

Rajas and Tamas Ordinarily used for 

psychological self-analysis, these distinctions are 
valid also in physical Nature.” ( Essays on the 
Gita) 

The terms Sattva, Rajas and Tamas which 
apply equally to the action of energy and 
thoughts, will perhaps be better understood if 
we first look into our own mind : 

1 . When our mind is in its normal 
state of rest or tranquillity, we feel pleasure or 
delight. This condition of the nr.ind, along with 
the pleasure or the delight, has been brought 
about by thought-waves moving in a certain 
way. We call this action of thoughts Sattva 
Guna. It corresponds to “Inertia” of 
the Physical world. Inertia does not mean 
inertness, but it is an effort of a moving 
body to remain in its own state of rest or 
motion. 

2. When, again, thoughts are in motion, 
i.e., when too many thoughts enter our mind. 



Introduction 


50 


As an illustration, let us consider how a 
tree grows : 

It grows by the action of the Rajas 
(acceleration). But if this were all, it would 
go on growing for ever and there would be 
no limit to its growth and it will grow to its 
full height in no time. This is not how a tree 
grows. 

What actually happens is that when it 
grows a little, Sattva Guna comes into play, 
for its tendency is to keep a body in its own 
state of motion or rest. Then Tamas comes 
to the aid of Sattva and both of them acting 
together retard the growth for a moment. But 
as soon as retardation starts, Sattva Guna 
acting with Rajas overcomes the retardation, 
and the tree again begins to grow and again 
it is checked, and so on. These processes of 
acceleration and retardation follow in quick 
succession and the tree grows slowly but surely. 
This is how Nature works.* 


' In passing, I may point out that according to 
Saihkhya, thought being only a form of energy is as 
inanimate (Acetana) as any other material object. The 
reservoir of all thoughts {viz. the Mind or, more correctly, 
the Buddhi) is also necessarily inanimate (Acetana). But 
it seems to be possessed of consciousness on account of 
its contact with the conscious Purusa (see Karika XX). 
In Western philosophy, thoughts and consciousness are

Part VI : Plurality of Soul. 

This subject, viz- plurality of Soul (in 
Karika no. XVIII) has been seized upon and 
made a ground of attack against Samkhya 
Philosophy by various commentators from the 
beginning of history. 

But let us first sec how Vedanta solved 
this important question. 

According to the Monism of Vedanta also 
there is no difference between the Brahman and 
the Soul — the Soul being nothing but pure and 
indivisible consciousness itself. 

The question then arose that if all Jivas 
have only a common soul, how is it then that 
all of them do not behave in the same way, 
have not the same sort of cognition, do not 
do the same act and enjoy the same fruit, and 
so forth — in short, how is it, then, that the 
world is not as nonsensical as it should have 
been, if all men were to have one common 
soul ? 


different aspects of the same thing, viz. of the same 
consciousness. (Eddington, Philosophy of Physical Science, 
pp. 202-205). This makes all the difference between 
Eastern and Western Psychology, Samkhya’s view helps 
a man whose object is self-realization. It makes it 
easy for him to differentiate the Buddhi from the Soul. 



Introduction 


61 


The matter was fully discussed in Chapter II, 
Part 3 of the Brahma-Sutra and Saihkaracarya 
solved the problem by saying that our perception 
is not at all a function of the functionless 
consciousness but it is a function of the 
Antahkarana (Brahma-Sutra, II, 3, 32) ; we see 
the world as our mind shows it. 

His conclusion, as I have shown above, 
is supported by modern science, for, science 
also has proved by experiment that the world 
of Physics is a mental phenomenon. 

Thus, Monism and Science have both 
agreed that the Physical universe is mental and 
therefore unreal ; the only difference being that 
science does not know why this world should 
be subjective or mental, while Monism says 
that it is so, because all men have a common 
soul. 

This solution of Monism was not accepted 
by the other great teachers like Ramanuja 
because, according to their old Psychology, 
mental perception was possible only in dreams. 
In the waking state, an object, in order to 
be seen, must really exist as an object before 
our eyes. They, therefore, contended that we 
are not living in a dream-world ; that we are, 
all of us, not dreaming the same dreani at a 
time ; that the world must be real and that 
things must be what they are to our view. 



62 


Saihkhya Karika of Uvarakrsna 


Their solution of the above problem, 
therefore, was that the Jiva is not merely 
consciousness itself but he is consciousness 
enveloped in the ‘Liihga Sarira’, i.e.^ in the 
sensory equipment.^ 

If we take this definition of a Jiva, then, 
of course, there is no doubt that the world 
is as we see it, and that it is absolutely real. 

Here, the only drawback is that this 
conclusion is not supported by modern science, 
for science says, “To welter in a barren realism 
of the world, is a negation of all that physical 
science has accomplished in unravelling the 
complexity of sensory experience.” (Eddington, 
Mew Path-ways in Science) 

Now, returning to the Saihkhya philosophy, 
it cannot accept the first solution, viz. the 
solution of Monism, for the obvious reason 
that Saihkhya had begun its investigation by 
assuming that the world is real. It was only 
at the end of the investigation that we were 
told that we actually see the world as our 
mind (Buddhi) shows it. (See my notes under 
Karika XIX.) (This is exactly the procedure 
of science — ^to begin by taking things as they 
are and then arrive at the reality.) 

«i: a*** • 



Introduction 


63 


Sariikhya cannot accept the second solution, 
viz. that the Purusa (Jiva) is an assemblage 
of consciouness and ‘Lirhga Sarira’, for it would 
cut at the very root of his philosophy, whose 
only object is to make God-realization easy 
for the ordinary man by discriminating the 
Soul from the ‘Lirhga’ from the very beginning. 

Accordingly he said that for the purpose 
of his enquiry it was not necessary at that 
stage to know what the Soul really is — that 
being a matter which is under enquiry ; that, 
in the meantime, we eould take things as they 
are, and accept the known fact that men behave 
differently, they all do not die at the same 
time, they have different sorts of cognition and 
so forth. We can, it went on to say, therefore 
take it that each man has a soul, without 
knowing the exact nature of the soul. 

He could not have done better without 
admitting the world to be unreal. 

Sri Aurobindo has put the whole matter 
in a nutshell when he says : 

“...but the infinite difference of view and 
outlook and attitude, action and experience — 
a difference not of the natural operations which 
are the same but of the witnessing consciousness — 
are utterly inexplicable except on the supposition 
that there is a multiplicity of witnesses, many 
Purusas : 



64 


Sarhkhya Karika of limrakfsna 


. . . The only at all logical explanation 
from the point of view of Vedantic Monism 
is that of the Mayavada, but there, the whole 
thing becomes a dream.... The more realistic 
Samkhya view of things does not admit this 
phantasmagoric idea of existence and therefore 
cannot adopt this solution.” ( Essays on the 
Gita) 


Part VII : Saihkhya’s Psychology. 

I had had an occasion, a little while ago, 
to refer to the old Indian Psychology (which 
was also the Psychology of Europe) according to 
which energy emanating from the sense-organs 
goes to the object to be seen, seizes it and 
brings a picture of it which is presented to 
the mind. The mind reads the picture and then 
cognition ensues. 

This old Psychology has now been discarded 
in Europe after a long series of controversy 
between the philosophers and the scientists 
there. ^ 

A very brief account of the Psychology 


^ It is highly interesting and more highly instructive 
to follow these controversies. The curious reader is 
referred to Miss Stebbing’s Philosophy and the Physicists, 
and Eddington’s The New Path-ways in Science,

has been given in Part I of this Introduction. 
It has now been firmly established by experi- 
ments that nothing goes out from our sense- 
organs. These organs possess no energy to 
transmit. They are merely apertures, as it were, 
through which energy emitted by the external 
objects enters into the cerebral centres. 

I have already shown above that according 
to this new Psychology we are living as it 
were in a prison-house from which we see 
nothing of the external world except in so far 
as we receive some electro-magnetic vibrations 
which our mind turns into shapes, colours and 
attributes, thus making these appear as solid 
objects to our vision. Accordingly, if we see 
anything, we see the mind, and all the subse- 
quent processes are only inferences made by 
the mind. Eddington says : “Mind is the first 
and the most direct thing in our experience ; 
all else is remote inference.” 

Thi§ new Psychology is exactly what the 
old Samkhya Philosophy teaches us. For, in 
Karika XXVIII, it has been clearly said that 
energy transmitted by the objects falls on our 
sense-organs and produce a sensation which is 
quite indeterminate and is without any form 
or attribute. Samkhya calls this sensation 
“Alocana”. 

To this “Alocana” the mind adds forms, 
5 



66 


SMikhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


qualifications and attributes, and then only we 
can have cognition of the object.* 

Thus, according to Saifakhya also, our 
knowledge of external objects is only a process 
of “mind-spinning” (a phrase from Eddington). 

According to Samkhya also we see nothing 
but our mind (Buddhi). In Karika XIX, the 
Purusa has been defined as the Seer of the 
Buddhi. He sees the Buddhi and nothing 
else. 

So far, therefore, Saiiikhya’s psychology 
supports the new Psychology of Europe. But 
there is an important difference. 

I have shown above that sensation and 
cognition are, both of them, functions of the 
Buddhi. Now, perception must surely be an act 
of consciousness. But, according to Samkhya, 
the Buddhi is an inanimate substance. How is 
it then that Buddhi can be both sentient and 
sapient ? 

This question does not arise in Western 
Philosophy because it holds that both sensation 
and perception constitute but one single process 
of activity of the same consciousness ; in other 
words, it holds that thoughts are also conscious 
and so is the mind. 

Samkhya cannot accept this view for 


‘ See Karika XXVIII.

obvious reasons. According to it, thoughts also 
are inanimate objects, as I have said before. 

According to Saihkhya, the Buddhi is like 
a slate on which thoughts are being written 
from the time of the creation up till now. The 
writing on the slate is changing every moment 
due to new thoughts coming in and destroying 
or re-inforcing the old ones. 

The final writing (or the shape of the 
Buddhi) at any given moment is what we are 
concerned with at that moment. 

The final shape is called the Adhyavasaya 
of the Buddhi at that moment.* 

The Purusa sees this final shape of the 
Buddhi like a man seeing a photograph. It is 
actually a mental photograph of all the thoughts 
in the Buddhi for the time being. A photo- 
graph has no meaning until a man looks at it 
and assigns a meaning and then only it 
becomes a living picture. 

In the same way when the Purusa looks 
at the Buddhi’s shape, he understands it and 
the latter also receives an induced consciousness, 
as it were, and appears to behave like a

conscious being (See Karika XX). It is this 
Adhyavasaya of the Buddhi from which 
auto-suggestion for all actions is derived. The 
organs of action automatically act according 
to this auto-suggestion, as will be explained in 
Karikas XXX and XXXI. To make the point 
clearer, it has been distinctly said in Karika 
XXXI that the organs discharge their 
respective functions automatically and neither 
God nor the Purusa works them. They are so 
organized that they act automatically.

I. Being afflicted by three-fold affliction, 
man desires to enquire about a means to end 
it ; if you say that there are well-known ways 
to end affliction and so further enquiry is 
unnecessary, my reply is : “No, these ways are 
not certain and they cannot remove affliction 
finally and once for all.” 

Notes 

1. Three-fold affliction : 

(i) Adhyatmika — bodily or mental pain, 
e.g.i disease, sorrow etc. 

(it) Adhibhautika — aflliction caused by 

acts of men and animals, e.g., snake- 
bite, bodily hurt etc. 

(tit) Adhidaivika — affliction caused by acts 
of God or due to supernatural causes, 
e.g., death of relatives, death by 
lightning.

2. The known means to remove misery, 
e.g., treatment of a disease, are not only un- 
certain but also unable to remove the root cause 
of misery, so that the same misery may come 
again.

II. The scriptural means to end misery is 
equally ineffective, because it is linked with 
impurity, its effect is neither lasting nor always 
the same for all. Different therefrom and 
superior thereto is the means to be obtained 
by an intimate knowledge of the Vyakta, the 
Avyakta and the Jna. 

Notes 

* 

1. The Sastras prescribe sacrifices and 
other religious ceremonies by which a man can 
go to heaven after his death. Some sacrifices 
sanction the killing of animals which is an 
offence against morality. Apart from that, heaven 
is not a place of unalloyed bliss. There are 
different kinds of enjoyment there, according

image in a mirror, or does he see it like a 
visionary visualizing in his own mind ? 

“No”, says Saihkhya. “The Purusa, by 
parting, with Prakrti, had also lost the equipment 
by which a man can see an image with an eye 
or visualize with a mind. The Purusa simply 
finds himself in the same status as he had had 
before entering into this world of woes ; he 
now knows that the Prakrti, which so long 
concealed the reality from him, was his own 
shadow. This is exactly the idea conveyed in 
Karika No. LXV below.

III. The Prakrti in her original state (as 
opposed to the Pradhana of Karika XI, which 
is her subsequent state when her Gunas come 
into action) is not a product of any change ; 
the seven Tattvas (viz-, Mahattattva, Ahamkara 
and the 5 Tanmatras) are products of changes 
from one state to another, each Tattva being 
related to the other immediately coming after 
it, in the relation of producer and product or

cause and effect *, the 16 Tattvas {viz-t the 
5 Mahabhutas which are the products of the 
Tanmatras, the 10 sense-organs together with 

the mind which form the 11 products of the 
Ahaihkara Tattva) are final products which 
suffer no further change of state and, for the 
reason of that, are not the producers of 

anything else. The Purusa is neither the cause 
nor the result of any change. 

Notes 

1. The twenty-four Tattvas (including 

Prakrti) arc the only ingredients of both the 
worlds (the physical-world and the sense-world) 
and they form therefore the only subject- 

matter of our enquiry as to what we see or 
know and how. The various material objects 
of various shapes and colour in this world 
do not concern us in our present enquiry, 
because they arc nothing but a mere assemblage 
of Tanmatras only. These Tattvas have been 
explained in the Introduction. 

2. Note that, according to this Karika, 

Purusa and primal Prakrti are both causeless 

( Ahetumat ) and, for the reason of that, 
Avyakta of Karika X. 

Now, we proceed to enquire what we 
see and how we decide that our seeing is a true 
seeing.

Saihkhya Karika of livarakrsna 


Indian philosophers that a Sruti-vacana (a 
Saying of Veda) is the only infallible proof, 
the validity of which cannot be questioned. 

Samkhya’s attitude towards the Vedas 
does not seem to be so respectful as that ; for, 
its object is to explain spiritual matters by 
very simple reasoning or by common-sense 
arguments, to all people, at all time, irres- 
pective of their religious faith.

V. Direct cognition is the final ascertain- 
ment of objects by the Buddhi ( Adhyavasaya) . 
Inference, which is based on a prior knowledge 
of a symbol and its relation to another symbol, 
is of three kinds. But Aptavacana is verbal 
testimony of a truthful and wise man. 


Notes 

1. The word ‘tu’ here implies that accor- 
ding to Sarhkhya also, Aptavacana as a mode 
of proof is more reliable than the other two 
methods. 



Karikas 


77 


2. As regard the second mode of proof 
(Logical Inference), it requires a major term 
and a middle term, without which no inference 
can be drawn, and it is of three kinds, viz., 

(i) Drstavat, e.g., to infer the existence 
of a fire by seeing the smoke from 
a distance ; 

(«) Sesavat — to deduce the characteristics 
of the whole by examining a part of 
it as a sample ; 

(iii) Samanyatodrsta — ^which is Inductive 
Logic. 

3. As regards direct cognition the most 
important thing to remember is that according 
to Samkhya’s Psychology which has been 
explained above, the final ascertainment of the 
object to be observed is the “Adhyvasaya” or 
the Buddhi.

(5) exterme subtlety of the object, e.g., an 
atom ; 

(6) the object to be observed being veiled 
or suppressed ; 

(7) the object being mixed up with similar 
things.

VIII. Non-perception of the Prakrti is 
due to its subtlety and not to non-existence ; 
since its existence can be inferred as being a 
cause of Mahattattva and the othersj some of 
which are like it and the others unlike. 


Notes 

The idea is that every action (or change) 
has a cause and that the caused always exists in 
latent form in its cause, as will be explained 
in the next Karika. 

Some of the effects produced by the action of 
the Prakrti, viz^t the Mahattattva, the Ahaihkara 
Tattva and the Tanmatras, are unobservable 
like Prakrti itself and some, viz-t the mind, 
Buddhi and the sense-organs and the five 
Mahabhutas are, unlike Prakrti, observable. 
From all these Tattvas we can reasonably 
infer that Prakrti exists as their cause.

IX. The effect even prior to its manifesta- 
tion always exists as a real entity in its cause 
(which also must always be a real entity), as 
the following considerations will show : 

(1) Asadakaranat : Nothing can be produced 
out of a thing which is as non-existent as the 
barren woman’s son. 

(2) Upadanagrahanat : In producing any- 
thing, one has to have recourse to the proper 
materials out of which only that thing can be 
produced. We cannot produce curd from water. 
Only milk can produce it. This shows that 
the effect has a certain fixed relation to its 
cause. 

(3) Sarva Sambhavabhavat : It is not 
possible to press out oil from sand. Oil can 
be obtained from mustard seed or such other 
seeds in which it exists. This shows that the 
effect always exists in latent form in its cause ; 
otherwise, it would be possible to produce all 
things from anything. 

(4) Saktasya Sakyakaranat : It is common 
knowledge that the effect must be such as is 
within the power of the cause to create. 



Karikas 


81 


There must therefore be a relation between the 
cause and the effect as regards potency also. 

(5) Karanabhavat : The cause and its 
effect have inherent or intrinsic similarity or 
they may be as non-different as the woven 
cloth from its cause, viz.t the threads. 

According to Samkhya, everything has a 
cause. The cause and its effect always co- 
exist even before the latter becomes known or 
visible. Nothing happens by chance. Chance, 
according to Samkhya, is a meaningless word 
used by us to cover our own ignorance when 
we cannot ascertain the cause of a thing. As 
shown in Karika III above, the whole universe 
is a continuous process of change of causes 
into their effects.^ The root cause, which itself 
is causeless, is Avyakta of the next Karika.

Karikas

Philosophy primarily deals with the sense-world 
but it has been so written that the Karikas 
apply equally to both the worlds. How is it, 
then, that Buddhi, mind and the sense-organs 
(which are Vyaktas) have dimensions or shapes ? 

The answer is that all material objects 
have four dimensions — three in space and one 
(viz.f duration) in time. 

Buddhi and the others have only a time- 
dimension. As has been stated above, the 
Buddhi is supposed to be a slate on which 
are recorded the events of the external world. 
The writing is changing every moment and 
along with it, the shape of the Buddhi is also 
changing. 

In the next Karika it will be stated that 
Avyakta is conscious and the Vyakta is non- 
conscious, or in other words, the Avyakta is 
the “Seer” and the Vyakta is the “seen”. Why 
this must be so has been explained in Part III 
of the Introduction.

(The expression Tathaca in Sanskrit is a 
phrase, the meaning of which is, “notwithstanding 
all that has been said above”.) 

XI. Notwithstanding what has been said 
above (in Karika III as to Prakrti and Puman 
being the same Avyakta) Prakrti or Pradhana in 
the manifested state, like any other manifested 
object (Vyakta), is composed of the three 
Gunas ; inseparable from the said Gunas ; 
object of the senses, common object of cognition 
for all observers alike ; non-conscious ; and 
productive ; but the Puman being the reverse 
of these remains Avyakta as before. 

Notes 

1. It will be explained in Karika XIV 
that this change of status of changeless primal 
Prakrti occured because Prakrti’s three Gunas 
are now operating. Without these Gunas, 
nothing can be an object of cognition, nothing 
can be productive, and nothing could be “seen” 
by a “Seer” (See Introduction, Part III). 

2. Aviveki — The manifested object being 
nothing but so many assemblages of Gunas are 
inseparable from the latter. I have shown in 
the Introduction how this conclusion of Samkhya 
has been now experimentally verified by the 
Quantum Theory, according to which there is 
nothing in matter except the three modes of 



Karikas 


85 


activity of energy (mass, momentum and 
stress) . 

3. The word Puman has given rise to 
some confusion amongst the commentators. 
Gaudapada said that the Puman of this Karika 
is always one and cannot be many. Other 
commentators think that Gaudapada has 
probably made a mistake because, according to 
the Samkhya Philosophy, Purusas are many, 
and Puman is the same thing as Purusa. 

It is unnecessary to point out how 
Gaudapada has very rightly interpreted the 
Karika. He has made it clear that the same 
Puman, from above space-time, manifested 
himself as many Purusas below. This is quite 
a Vedantic conception of creation.

XIII. Sattva Guna is said to be light and 
illumining ; Rajas, stimulating and accelerating ; 
Tamas, heavy and restraining ; these three 
Gunas act in co-operation towards a goal just 
like a lamp. 


Notes 

1 . Wick, oil and fire — three different 
things, opposed to each other, co-operate in a 
lamp, the object of which is to give a light. 
So do the three Gunas of opposite characteri- 
stics co-operate and act towards an object. 

The object of this activity of the Gunas is, 
according to Samkhya, the enjoyment of the 
sdul and its final release from all miseries. 

2. The Gunas give rise to pleasure, sorrow 
or delusion in the mind ; but it will be a 
mistake to suppose that they are the same thing 
as those feelings. Those feelings have no 



Karikas 


87 


objectivity. They have no existence of their 
own apart from a human mind. But the Gunas 
exist in their own right and as a matter of 
fact ; nothing in the world can exist without 
them. The Gunas, and the feelings they give 
rise to, are related to each other as cause and 
effect (See Karika XXXVIII below).

XIV. The attributes — inseparableness, 

objectivity, non -consciousness etc. (mentioned in 
Karika XI) — of the Vyakta follow from the very 
fact that the Vyakta is composed entirely of 
the three Gunas and that it could not exist 
if it were not so composed ; the effect being 
of the same nature as its cause, the Avyakta 
is also known {i.e.t we can know that the 
Gunas must have existed in latent form in the 
Avyakta) . 

Notes 

This most important Karika not only 
explains itself in the light of what has been 



88 


SMikhya Karikia of lharakrsna 


said in the Introduction, Part III, but it also 
explains how and wherefrom non-consciousness 
could come into this world. 

Take away the Gunas and the whole space 
including all that it contains vanishes at once. 
Nothing now remains except the conscious 
Avyakta which, as will be shown in the next 
Karika, is the only cause of the creation 
including the Gunas themselves. 

XV. ^*!t I 

bhedanam parimanat,

avibhagad-vaisvarupyasya li 

(The clause “ Karanamasty-avyaktam” in the 
first line of the next Karika is the concluding 
portion of this Karika and not a part of 
Karika XVI.) 

XV. That the Avyakta is the root cause 
of this creation can be inferred from the 
following five considerations : 

(1) Bhedanam Parimanal : The finitude of 
the diverse : — All the various objects begin- 
ning from Mahattattva are finite and limited 
and must therefore be caused. That cause 
again must have its own cause, that again a 



Karihas 


89 


third cause and so on. Ultimately we arrive 
at an uncaused cause, and that is the Avyakta of 
Karika X — the root cause of the whole creation. 

(2) Samanvayat : Sameness in diversity : — 
If we think of the various objects in the world, 
we find that they have a common characteri- 
stic, viz.y that they are all made of the Three 
Gunas. Take away the Gunas and you arrive 
at the Avyakta. It follows therefore that the 
Avyakta is the root cause of all. 

(3) Saktitah Pravrttesca : The effect depend- 
ing on the potentiality of the cause, as explained 
above in Karika IX. 

When we consider about the magnitude of 
the activity of the universe, we cannot but be 
convinced that there must be an immense 
immeasurable force at work. This force being 
observable and for the reason of that a Vyakta 
element, it cannot exist without depending on 
a support (Asrita of Karika X). If we go on 
thinking, we find that the last support must 
be itself supportlcss (Anasrita), i.e., the Avyakta 
of Karika X. 

(4) Karanakarya-vibhagat : The distinction 
made between the cause and its effects : — The 
Vyaktas (including the Pradhana) are caused, but 
they cannot be exactly of the same description 
as their causes, for, that would mean a 
complete merger of effects into their causes. 



90 


Samkhya Karika of Isvaraktsna 


What distinguish the Vyaktas from their cause 
are the five attributes mentioned in Karika XL 
Take them away and you arrive at the cause 
which obviously is the Avyakta of Karika X. 

(5) Vaiharupya^a Avibhagat : Continuity 
of the diversity of the Universe : — The diverse 
objects in this Universe beginning from Mahat- 
tattva downwards are the result of a conti- 
nuous change of causes into effects as explained 
above. Now, at dissolution, the reverse 
processes, i.e., merger of efi'ects into their causes, 
must happen. Thus the Mahabhutas will merge 
into their cause, i.e., the Tanmatras, the 
Tanmatras into the Aharhkara Tattva and the 
latter into Pradhana and Pradhana into the 
Avyakta. 

In the same way, the entire sense-world 
will merge into the same Aharhkara Tattva and 
finally into the Avyakta which is the root 
cause of the whole creation. 

Notes 

1. Now, it being established that there is 
nothing in this world except the activity of the 
three Gunas, the question arises, how then do 
we see so many objects of various shapes and 
colour around us. 

I have shown above how this very question 
arose in Europe about thirty years ago and how 



Karikas 


91 


the scientists there solved it by their new 
Psychology. 

In the next Karika, Saihkhya has solved 
the very same problem by the same psychology. 

XVI. I 

karanam-asty-avyaktam 

pravartate trigunatah samudayac-ca I 
parinamatah salilavat 

pratipratigunasrayavisesat II 

XVI. Diversity of colour, taste, smell 
etc. arises from the three Gunas acting in 
co-operation in various ways on various objects 
with which they come into contact ; just as 
water gives rise to various tastes in various 
plants that absorb it. 

Notes 

1. A ray of 'white sunlight ( Rupa 
Tanmatra ) has no distinguishing ( Visesa ) 
colour. It is only a bare particle of energy. But 
when it falls on a prism or a dew-drop, it 
decomposes itself into its components and thus 
gives rise to various colours. Similarly Rasa 
Tanmatra, which forms water and which has 
no taste of its own, gives rise to various tastes 
when it comes in contact with various objects 



92 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


as stated in this Karika. The five Tanmatras, 
which are mere particles of energy, give rise 
to all sorts of colour, taste, sound etc. ( See 
Karika XXXIV). (Compare Fourier’s Theorem 
— The Visesa of Samkhya being exactly 
Fourier’s Components of Mathematics.) 

2. Now, our search into the Physical 
Universe is at an end. We find that there is 
nothing in it except a play of the three Gunas, 
but there is a method in this play, for, the 
Gunas work towards an object. They work 
from the direction of cause to effect and never 
in the opposite direction, viz-t from effect to 
cause. Moreover, we find that they work in 
co-operation with precise regularity like three 
intelligent persons working together with a 
common purpose. Who organized them to 
work in the way they are doing ? Let us, 
therefore, peep into the other world — viz^t the 
sense-world, without which the physical world 
would be quite meaningless.

XVII. The Purusa must exist) because : 

(1) Sarhghata Pararthatvat : We have nothing 
to worry about when inanimate things lie scat- 
tered about here and there without any symmetry 
or arrangement. But when we find that they 
are so arranged that they can serve an useful 
purpose, wc know that an intelligent person 
must have arranged them for himself or for 
another. The very symmetry, order and law 
of the universe afford a proof therefore that 
the Purusa exists. 

(2) Trigunadiviparyayad : The person referred 
to above is surely unlike, or* the reverse of, 
the things arranged by him. The things are 
non-conscious and mere objects of the senses 
(as per Karika XI). He must therefore be 
conscious, not an object of the senses — or, in 
other words, he must be the Seer. 

(3) Adhisthdndt : Inanimate things cannot 
work or serve an useful purpose unless they 
are directed into a proper channel by an 
intelligent being, just as a motor car cannot 
run without a driver. 

(4) Bhoktrbhdvat : There is surely some 
one to enjoy (otherwise the whole creation will 
be meaningless). 

. (5) Kaivalyartham Pravrtteica : There is a 
desire (as said in Karika I) for absolute release 
from misery. This desire cannot be of the 



94 


Samkhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


Buddhi or of any inanimate substance like 
Prakrti, because, as will be shown hereafter, 
absolute release cannot be had without parting 
from the Buddhi or destroying it altogether. 
Buddhi cannot be said to desire its own 
destruction. This desire must belong to one 
who is not the Buddhi. 

Notes 

1. This Karika is not difficult to understand. 
The only thing to remember about it is that it 
applies equally to both the worlds. In the 
sense-world the inanimate things referred to are 
our Buddhi and the whole sensory equipment 
and the organizer is our soul. In the entire 
physical universe the organizer is the Puman 
of Karika XI. 

2. The main argument here is : 

(i) Sariighata Pararthatvat, i.e., there can 
be no order, law, symmetry or co-operation in 
an assemblage of inanimate objects unless some 
intelligent being had skilfully arranged them to 
work for a certain object and under fixed 
laws. 

In the physical world it is our daily 
experience that such an organization exists. We 
have also discovered most of the Laws there. 

In the sense-world also we find the same 
design, harmony and co-operation amongst the 



Karikas

sense-organs and there are fixed laws under 
which they function (See Karika XXX and 
XXXI).

and the action of the Indriyas being different 
for different individuals ; all men not having 
the same inclinations at the same time ; the 
thoughts arising out of the action of the three 
Gunas being different for different men — it 
follows that souls (Purusas) are many (each man 
having a separate soul — See Introduction).

XIX. And from the contrast with the 
three Gunas follow the characteristics of the

SaAikkya Karika of Isvarakrsna 


Purusa being merely a witness, arbitrator, or 
Seer, with no activity of its own, free of all 
connections with anything, and thus standing 
alone by itself. 

Notes 

1. Being pure consciousness, the Purusa 

has no activity. He lives in his prison-house 
from which he can see nothing but his Buddhi. 
He sees it and gives a meaning to it just as a 
man sees a photograph and understands it. He 
has no similarity with anything else — he being 
conscious and everything else being the reverse. 

2. The most important thing in this 

Karika is the inactivity of the Soul, leading to 
the controversy about free will. This question 
has been very elaborately discussed in the Gita. 
It is not necessary to go into it here again, for, 
it has been easily solved by the Samkhya 

Philosophy. 

It is now admitted by all that the spring 
of all our actions comes from what modern 

science calls the “Sub-conscious mind” and its 
“Auto-suggestion”. (In Indian Philosophy we 
call the sub-conscious mind our “Sarhskara” or 
“Limga Sarira”.^ 

^ As regards the difference between the Saihskara or 
Buddhi and the Limga Sarira, see my booklet in Assamese 
“Janmantara Rahasya”, p. 88, footnote 2. 



Karikas 


97 


This being so, if it be held (as has been 
held by many) that the Liihga or Buddhi, with 
its induced consciousness, is the Soul, then 
there is absolutely no doubt that we are all 
of us free agents. 

But Samkhya does not say so. As stated 
above, according to it the Soul stands alone 
and is quite a separate thing frcftn Buddhi. It 
has no activity of its own. The question of 
free will does not arise at all in this philo&gt; 
sophy. The only question which arises is this — 
“If the Soul is not the doer, why do then 
men think that they are the doers of their 
actions ?" 

This question has been answered in the 
next Karika.

XX. Hence {i.e.y from the fact that the 
Purusa contemplates upon the Buddhi) the 
Limga, i.e.y the non-conscious Buddhi, by virtue 
of its connection (Saipyoga) with the Purusa 
behaves like a conscious being or appears to 
7 



98 


Samkhya Karika oj livarakfs^ 


be conscious ; thus, though activity is a function 
of the Gunas only, the disinterested non-doer 
{i.e., the Purusa) thinks himself to be the 
doer. 


Notes 

, 1. This is why a man thinks that he is 

the doer of his actions. He thinks the 
Samskara to be his soul and according to 
Samkhya it is ignorance to think the Satnskara 
to be the soul (Karika XLVIII).

XXI. This connection (samyoga) of the 
Pradhana (Buddhi) with the Purusa is like the 
association of a blind man with a lame one, 
and it serves a dual purpose of the Pradhana 
being contemplated upon by the Purusa and 
the consequent attainment of kaivalya ( the 
state of loneliness or release) by the latter. 
Thus they two have made the creation what 

It IS. 



Karikas 


99 


Notes 

1. The word Sainyoga which occurs in 
these Karikas is not like a mere contact of 
one object with another. It is like a contact 
of the mind with a matter, e.g.^ 

(t) I can sing, but I do not always 
sing. I sing when I think of singing. 
This is the Samyoga of the mind 
with a song. 

(ti) Thoughts are always within me, but 
1 am not aware of them. I recall 
a thought to my consciousness 

when occasion arises. This is a 
satnyoga of the consciousness with 

the inanimate or dead thought stored 
up in Buddhi from a long time. 

2. This association (Samyoga) of the Purusa 

and Prakrti is as eternal as the world itself. 
Without it there would be no seer and nothing 
to see. But at the same time it is not a 

natural or inseparable connection as exists 
between the fire and its heat. The heat cannot 
be separated, or thought of separately, from 
the fire. Not so inseparable is the connection 
between the Purusa and the Prakrti. We 

daily remain separated from Prakrti in our deep 
and dreamless sleep when our thoughts lie 
dormant. 

3. It is only when a man can part with 



100 


Samkhya Karika of livarakf^na 


Prakrti that he can attain the supreme state 
of freedom and happiness. The illustration of a 
blind man carrying a lame one is therefore quite 
apt and full of meaning. These two men 
associate for a common purpose, viz., going to 
a distant place, and they separate as soon as 
their common object is attained ; so is the 
Purusa linked with Prakrti for a particular 
object {i.e., for our enjoyment) and they must 
part as soon as that object is attained.

XXII. From Prakrti proceeds the Maha&gt; 
ttattva (equivalent to Buddhi) ; thence the 
Ahamkara Tattva (the ego-sense) ; thence the 
aggregate of the sixteen (11 sense-organs, 
including the mind, and the 5 Tanmatras) ; 
and from the latter five the five Mahabhutas 
come out. 


Notes 

1. These are the only ingredients of the 
sense-world — which we are now enquiring into.

XXIII. Determination (Adhyavasaya) is 
the Buddhi ; virtue, wisdom, non-attachment 
and super-human power constitute its Sattvika 
form ; the reverse of these constitute its Tamasa 
form. 


Notes 

1. It has been stated above that the 
Buddhi or the Limga or the Samskara — all these 
three terms, for our present purpose, implying 
the same things — is only a store-house of 
thoughts and nothing more. Samkhya has now 
classified these thoughts into eight categories 
as stated in this Karika. For the sake of 
simplicity, the Gita has classified them into 
three categories only, viz-t Sattvika, Rajasika 
and Tamasika. This has been done with a 
view to showing how the stored-up thoughts 
determine the quality of all our actions, our 
character and everything else. Our actions, our 
food, our temper and everything else have been 
classified into the same three divisions. A man, 



102 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakfsna 


it is said, of Sattvika nature can do only 
Sattvika actions, can take only Sattvika food 
and so forth. Conversely, if we know that a 
man always does Sattvika actions or is fond of 
Sattvika food, we may be sure that his thoughts 
are Sattvika also. 

This is how we can guess what actions a 
man is likely to do and what he cannot do. 
That is to say, his actions are controlled, and 
their quality is determined by rules of thoughts 
and not by himself {i.e,, not by his soul). It is 
these thoughts which make the man what he is. 

2. When a man does any little action, its 
effect pervades throughout the world and it 
alters the course of the world, more or less, for 
all time to come. Suppose, I set fire to a 
forest. I have nothing more to do with this 
action of mine. What I have done is done 
and it cannot be undone. But its effect will 
be to disturb the meteorological conditions of 
the whole world — there may be scarcity of 
food in one place, excessive rain in another, 
causing the breach of a bridge, and ending in 
a railway accident and so forth. I have altered 
the future course of the world. This sort of 
effect of an action is not what I am directly 
concerned with. I am concerned only with the 
effect that my action has upon my Buddhi. 
Every little action that I do, or every little 



Karikas 


103 


thought that I think, alters the shape of the 
Buddhi, as stated above, and this altered shape 
determines my future action and the latter again 
alters the shape of the Buddhi still more and 
this altered shape determines my subsequent 
actions — and so on for ever. The action and 
reaction between the Buddhi and the thoughts 
have been going on cearelessly from the day 
of creation and will so go on till its end. All 
actions thus end in thoughts with which alone 
I am directly concerned. 

This is what Samkhya calls ‘fruit of action’ 
(See Karikas XLIV &amp; XLV below). 

He knows of no other ‘fruit of action’ and 
according to him thought includes ‘action’. If 
we could entirely subdue the Sarpskara, no 
action of ours, however sinful, can have an 
effect on us in any way. (Compare Gita 
V, 7-12.) 

3. Samkhya has, to be quite comprehen- 
sive, classified these thoughts into eight catego- 
ries (not into three, as the Gita has done) . 
He shows that thoughts not only determine 
the quality of our actions, and our future 
transmigrations but they also give us the power 
to act. According to him, therefore, man is 
like a tethered animal tied to his Samskara as 
a post or pole. As the rope lengthens, i.e., as 
the Saipskara brightens up, not only the quality 



104 


Saihkkya Kcrika of livarakxsm 


of his act improves but he acquires more and 
more freedom of movement ; his power to do 
superhuman work increases. Finally, when he 
becomes free of the seven kinds of thoughts, 
his soul is released (see Karika LXIIl). This 
will be clear from a consideration of the eight 
categories into which thoughts have been 
divided : — 

(i) Jnana, i.e., Wisdom — It means the 
discriminative knowledge of the Soul 
and the Buddhi. 

(ii) Dharma, i.e.» Virtue — It means that 
sort of thought which enables man to 
live and prosper in this world and 
also ensures his spiritual progress. 

(in) Viraga — It is non-attachment to 
worldly matters. 

{iv) Aisvarya, i.e.j God-like power — It is 
the kind of thought which enables 
the yogins to do wonderful things by 
thinking of them alone ; such thoughts 
have been divided into eight kinds, 
viz- - — 

(a) Anima — the power to enter into all 
things. 

{b) Laghima, i.e.. Lightness — the power 
to rise up to the sky. 

(c) Garima — which enables the yogin to 
make his body extremely heavy. 



Karikas 


105 


(&lt;/) Mahima — Extensive magnitude. 

(e) isitva — Power to lord over anything. 
(/) Vasitva — Subjugation of all elements. 
{g) Prapti — That sort of thought which 
enables a man to get whatever he 
desires. 

(A) Prakamya — infallibility of purpose. 

(4) Thus the Sathkhya Philosophy has 
reduced the whole universe to two categories 
(actions having merged into thoughts), viz., 
consciousness and thoughts. The first is called 
Purusa, and the second, the seven forms (shapes) 
of Prakfti, which bind the Purusa (Karika 
LXIII). Later on it will be shown that thoughts 
have no objectivity of their own. The liberated 
Purusa knows this (Karika LXV) ; although a 
man as long as he is under bondage cannot 
think himself to have a separate existence apart 
from his thoughts.

separate entity ; therefrom arise the two kinds 
of creation — the eleven aggregates (sense-organs 
and the mind) and the five Tanmatras. 

Notes 

1. The ego-sense and the rest are a 
creation of the Buddhi. It will be shown 
hereafter how the Indriyas and the body are all 
created by the Buddhi and how the latter is 
responsible for all the infirmities of the former. 
It, no doubt, seems unnatural that a thought 
of the Buddhi can create anything. But the 
matter loses all its mysteries when we remember 
that, according to Samkhya, thoughts are only 
subtle energy and that it is only by thoughts 
that one can do super-human works, as stated 
in the preceding Karika.

form of Ahathkara which is known as Bhutadi 
(the origin of Bhuta or matter) ; it is of the 
nature of Tamas (dark or heavy) ; both these 
changes are by the action of the Taijasa 
Ahaihkara. 


Notes 

1. It is Rajas alone which can (in 
co-operation with the other two Gunas) effect any 
change at all. It is, therefore, called Taijasa 
(force or activity). Vaikrta, says Gaudapada, 
is the same thing as Sattvika.

XXVII. Here (among the Indriyas, both 
of cognition and of action) the Mind partakes 
the nature of both sets, it intends the function- 
ing of both the sets and is therefore an Indriya 
like both : the varieties noticed in the construc- 
tion and the working of the Indriyas are The 
result of the aetivity of the Gunas ; so are the 
varieties in the external world. 

Notes 

1. This Karika is self-explanatory. It is, 
however, interesting to note what Gaudapada 
has to say about the expression “bahya bhedah” 
occurring at the end of the Karika. 

He says that all changes and transform- 
ations in both these worlds are the works of 
the Gunas, for they are the only workers of 
changes. Without them, the worlds would be 
quite static. But, he goes on to say, the changes 
and transformations in the sense-world and those 
in the external world have an intimate 
correspondence. Thus, for instance, man requires 
an eye to see. The Gunas create the eye at 
the top of the head, so that seeing becomes 
easy. 



Karikas 


109 


The cow requires milk when a calf is born. 
She does not require it when the calf has 
grown up. The Gunas have, therefore, built 
her body in such a way that milk will flow 
of itself, when required, and will cease to flow 
when not required. 

Thus it appears as if Nature works with 
a design and a pre-thought. (Modern biology 
fmnishes many such illustrations).

XXVIII. In respect of sound etc. {i.e., 
sound, touch, colour, smell and taste), the 
function of the five organs of cognition is a 
mere indeterminate awareness called ‘alocana’ ; 
the functions of the five organs of action are 
speech, grasping, motion, excretion and sexual 
enjoyment. 

Notes 

1. The word *alocana’ has been explained 
by Vacaspati by quoting a passage from the 
Purana which runs as follows ; —

Buddhi, Ahihkara and Mind), each has its own 
function, — this is not common to all of these ; 
but the functions of the five Pranas (Prana, 
Apana, Udana, Vyana and Samana) are the 
functions which are common to all Indriyas. 

Notes 

J. The function of Buddhi is determina- 
tion ; that of Ahaihkara is self-consciousness ; 
that of the Mind is explication. But they 
cannot discharge their respective functions 
unless the Prana is functioning at the same 
time.

XXX. In the case of what is present to 
perception, the functioning of the four {viz.t 
the internal organs and one external organ) may 
be simultaneous or successive : similarly, in case 
of what is not present to perception (and 
therefore when none of the external organs 
have been functioning), the functioning of the 



112 


SaAtkhya Karika of livarakfsna 


three internal organs based on previous percep- 
tions, may be either simultaneous or successive. 

Notes 

1 . Suppose a man sees a snake and 
immediately runs away. Here, the various 
stages, i.e., the indeterminate seeing of the eye, 
the explication made by the mind, and the final 
determination to run away made by the Buddhi, 
followed in such quick succession that they may 
be considered to be simultaneous. 

2. I heard a sound and saw a man in 
the darkness of the night ; I looked carefully 
and saw a weapon in his hand ; I further 
noticed that he was coming towards me. I 
thought he might kill me and therefore I ran 
away. Here the functions of the organs took 
place successively. 

3. As regards matters not before us, the 
help of an external organ is not necessary. We 
perceive them by the internal organs alone. But 
in this case, a prior cognition is essential, 
because we cannot think of a thing which is not 
present as a thought in our Samskara ; we cannot 
imagine, for instance, of a particular taste which 
we have not tasted before. With this limitation, 
in cases of cognition by the internal organs 
alone, the processes of functioning may be 
either simultaneous or successive.

Notes 

1. This Karika is also self-explanatory in 
the light of all that has been said before. 
Gaudapada makes it clearer when he says that 
the organs are not worked by God or by the 
Purusa. The thirteen organs are the three 
internal and the ten external organs. They 
work automatically.

XXXII. The organs are of thirteen varie-

holding and illumining ; their actions arc also 
of ten varieties of the nature of carrying, 
holding and illumining. 

Notes 

1. Thus, the sense-organs illumine the 
Buddhi and the latter preserves (holds) the 
cognition as thoughts for ever. The organs 
of actions simply carry objects from one place 
to another (as the feet carry the body), 

2. Gaudapada has explained this Karika 
in a simpler way. According to him, carrying 
and holding are functions of the organs of 
action, while the sense-organs only illumine the 
Buddhi.

115 


in the present ; the internal organs can function 
{i.e., think) in the past, the present and* the 
future alike (without any distinction). 

Notes 

1. In his comments on this Karika, Vacaspati 
has explained why Samkhya does not recognise 
time as an independent or objective category. 
When we think of a series of past events 
(already known to us), and also of some future 
events which are likely to follow, the idea of 
time-interval does not occur to us. If time 
were an objective something, the idea of time- 
interval between two events would have been 
always there inseparably linked with the events 
themselves. Sarhkhya, therefore, begins by say- 
ing that the idea of time {i.e., astronomical 
time) is something which has no objectivity ; it 
is a creation of the mind but the ignorant man 
thinks it to be a substance. (See Yoga Sutra, 
Vyasa Bhasya, III, 5, 27.)* 

This is what he says about the astronomical 
time of the modern scientists. The relative and 
the only real time which the scientist speaks 
of, is not called time at all in the Samkhya 
Philosophy, for as I said above, it is only the 

‘ 9 5% Pwihi; itfeia 



116 


Sathkhya Karika of IsvarakTsna 


idea of our own existence (ego-sense) in an 
endfess time. 

I have stated in the Introduction, Part II, 
how this eternal time, together with the idea 
of an infinite space, is a result of individuation 
of the soul in Ahamkara Tattva. 

This endless time is flowing from past to 
future in a ceaseless current like a river. Just 
as the terms “Up” and “Down” in case of 
the river will be meaningless without reference 
to the position of an object on its bank, so 
will the terms past, present and future be 
quite meaningless unless they relate to a certain 
change in the physical world, or a certain 
action which we do. 

The false idea of an astronomical time 
arises out of, and ultimately vanishes into, the 
aforesaid eternal time (i.c., the ego-sense), as 
the following illustration will show : 

Suppose, I have to acquire a full knowledge 
of a particular object, say, an orange. I first 
see it and know its colour, shape and size ; 
next I smell it and know how it smells ; next 
I break it open or peel it and taste it, I 
know how it tastes. I do various acts one after 
another. I am smelling it now, this is my 
present ; seeing was my past and tasting will 
be my future. But all this time my ego-sense 
was with me. If one man smells, and another 



Karikas 


117 


tastes, neither of them will have a complete 
knowledge of the orange. The same “I” that 
did the smelling must also do the tasting. 
This is how knowledge is acquired and how 
the idea of past, present and future comes in. 

This is a result of our not being able 

to think of more than one thing at a time 
or doing more than one work at a time. 

If all knowledge were always present in our 
mind, the above successiveness of events 
would vanish at once, just as the idea of 
time-interval vanishes when we think of a 

series of known past events extending over a 
long period of time. 

Samkhya further says that the idea of 
both space and time (because they are linked 
together as stated above) occurs to us on 

account of the actions of the five Mahabhutas. 
(See Samkhya Sutra 2, 12.) 

If there were no objects or changes in the 
physical universe and consequently nothing to 
see or think about, the idea of time and space 
disappears. What will then remain will be 
the bare idea of self-existence. 

The two ideas, space and time, are 
inseparable according to modern science also : 

(1) ‘Henceforward space in itself and time 
in itself, as independent things, must sink into 
mere shadows.’ ( — Minkowski) 



118 Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsm 

(2) ‘Thus Nature knows nothing of space 
and time separately, being concerned only with 
the four-dimensional continuum in which space 
and time are welded inseparably together in- 
to the product we may designate as ‘Space- 
time’. (—Jeans) 

In classical physics they (time and space) 
were considered to be different objects and 
were measured with different units, viz-t a 
clock and a scale. This is why the Fitzgerald 
Contraction referred to in Part I of the 
Introduction arose in all their calculations.

1. The two words Avisesa and Visesa 
have been used in several places in these 
Karikas and always in the sense given to 
them in the Yoga Sutras. 

In Karika XVI where the word Visesa 
occurs, I indicated how the five Tanmatras are 
the sources of all tastes, colours, sounds, touches 
and smells in the world, whereas they them- 
selves have no specific taste, colour etc. of any 
kind. They are mere energy, but certain material 
objects, constructed in a certain way, have 
the power to split up these Tanmatras into 

their component parts, according to fixed laws 
(Fourier’s Theorem). Thus, white light falling 
on a spectroscope gives rise to all the various 
colours some of which we can see. The compo- 
nents are called Visesas and the Tanmatras 
are Avisesas. 

Now, it is said in this Karika that the 

sense-organs can take cognition of both the 

Visesas and Avisesas. This, as pointed out 

by Gaudapada, is true only of the gods and 
the sages, because the ordinary man cannot 

see the Tanmatras although they can know 

of its existence by inference. The organ of 
speech has sound as its object, and as 

regards this, sages, gods and men — all have 
the same power to convert thoughts into

XXXVIII. The Tanmatras are Avisesa ; 
from these five Tanmatras proceed five Maha- 
bhutas ; these (latter) are said to be Visesas ; 
(they are objects of our enjoyment) and they 
produce in our mind the feelings of tranquillity, 
horror or delusion (as the case may be) 
under different circumstances. 

Notes 

1. The Tanmatras, says Gaudapada, are 
enjoyable by gods and sages and they give 
pleasure to them alone. As said above, Tan- 
matras are not perceptible to human senses. 

2. It will be a mistake to suppose 
that the feelings of tranquillity, horror or 
delusion are attached to the material objects. 
Lest we should make such a mistake, Gauda- 
pada has given examples to show that the 
same object may be a source of delight to 
one, a source of sorrow to another and a 
source of delusion to a third. 

3. We were told in Karika XXII that 
the sense-world is a creation of thoughts of 
the Buddhi just as the physical world is a 



124 Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna 

Notes 

1. The two bodies born of parents are 
perishable. According to the commentators, 
hair, blood and flesh come from the mother, 
while bone, tendon and marrow are derived 
from the father. 

2. There is seemingly a very great 
difference between the Samkhya and the Vedanta 
about the conception of the Suksma body. 
According to Vedanta, the Suksma body is an 
assemblage of Buddhi, Mind, the ten organs, 
and the five Pranas, and this is also called the 
Limga.* 

Samkhya, however, contradicts the idea. 
It says that the Suksma body is only a 
Visesa, i.e., only a component of an Avisesa. 

That Avisesa is the Liihga referred to 
in the next two Karikas. It may be borne 
in mind that for all practical purposes we 
can take the Limga to be the same as Buddhi 
or the Samskara. It is this Limga which 
creates all the fourteen kinds of Suksma bodies 
of man and all other animals (See Karika LIII 
below). The Limga is thus the subtle energy 
(in the form of thoughts) which creates all the 
different types of the Suksma bodies.

is not attached to any particular body (t.c., 
which can assume all the fourteen kinds of 
subtle bodies) ; which is eternal ; which can 
penetrate into all subtle things from Mahattattva 
down-wards ; which cannot enjoy — this Liihga 
migrates. 

Notes 

1. This Limga being a mere subtle energy 
in potential state, and having not got a 
material body built up of Tanmatras, cannot 
enjoy. Moreover, being mere potential energy, 
it cannot even manifest itself unless it acts 
upon a grosser substance like the Tanmatras. 
In other words, it does not remain without 
a Suksma body. That is why Vedanta says 
that there is no difference between a Limga 
and a Suksma body. 

But Saihkhya’s conception of a separate 



126 


SaAikhya Karika of livarakrsna 


Limga is necessary to explain the process of 
transmigration. 

Animals and men have not the same type 
of Suksma body. When a man takes his rebirth 
as an animal or vice versa, how could the 
Suksma body change from one type to 
another ? 

Samkhya says that there is no difficulty, 
because the Limga is the Avisesa of all the 
Vi^esa Suksma bodies of all types. It can assume 
the requisite type of Suksma body, just as a ray 
of sunlight can assume any of its component 
colours according to the nature of the substance 
on which it falls. This will be explained in 
the next two Karikas.

thought) cannot manifest itself without a Vi^esa 
(a Suksma body), which it itself creates.

XLII. This Liihga&gt; by virtue of its 
connection with what may be called causes 
and their effects, behaves {i.e., migrates) like 
an actor in a play playing different parts ; 
it does so for the enjoyment and ultimate 
good of the Purusa ; all this is possible on 
account of Prakrti’s all-powerful nature. 

Notes 

1. The expression Prakrti’s “Vibhutva 
Yoga” indicates that transmigration also is a 
natural process. 

2. Ordinarily, we understand that a man 
goes either to heaven or hell, according to 
his own actions. As stated above, Saihkhya 
knows of no such fruit of action. It only 
knows the Samskara and the thoughts coming 
into it. They act and react upon each other, 
and their resultant at any given moment deter- 
mines our act at that particular moment. 

The resultant of all thoughts at the 
time of death, determines the next birth. 



128 


SaAikhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


The Lirhga first creates a Suksma body by this 
resultant force of thoughts. It may be any of the 
Suksma bodies of the several types ; viz.i Daiva 
(of gods), human, Gandharva ( of Gandharvas ) 
and so forth. Then the Lirhga enters into the 
new Suksma body, leaving the old one. 

On this point there is no difference 
between Sarhkhya and Vedanta, as I have 
shown in the Assamese booklet of mine referred 
to above. 

In this way the continuity of the Lirhga 
is preserved through all births. It only changes 
dress like an actor in a play. (Compare 
Gita, II, 22). 

3. Rebirth is necessary for the good of the 
Purusa, says Sarhkhya, because it is a natural 
process of evolution towards self-realization, i.e., 
to grow in knowledge, power and delight.

he had worldly thoughts in his mind which 
alone can furnish him with the code to 
read a cipher message or a key to an index-

Accordingly, science now thinks it to be 
an open question whether some of our thoughts 
are not innate : 

“This question”, says Eddington, “may be 
like enquiring whether the hen came first or the 
egg ; and it is not very important to decide. 
We might well leave the question open, 
whether the ‘form of thoughts’ that dominate 
our outlook are acquired or innate.” {Philosophy 
of Physical Science, p. 112). (This matter has 
been discussed at greater length in my Assamese

of Rajasika thoughts, makes a man passionately 
attached to the world. Aisvarya leads to non- 
obstruction of desire (t.c., it enables one to 
get whatever he wishes for), the opposite, (i.^., 
Anaisvarya) gives the contrary result. 

Notes 

1. These are the causes and the effects 
spoken of in Karika XLII above.^ See also

world we are concerned with our thoughts 
alone. Thoughts determine our actions, our 
conduct and our rebirth. Thoughts are the

Sarhkhya Karika of livarakfsna 


ultimate cause of everything that concerns us. 
It will be said later on that when a man can 
get rid of all these seven kinds of thoughts 
he attains liberation. 

3. Our search into the sense- world is 
now over. We have understood how we 
perceive by our sense-organs. It will be 
shown in the next six Karikas how difficult it 
is for us to obtain true knowledge of anything 
with our sensory equipment just described. 

We were told that we can acquire true 
physical or symbolical knowledge (as opposed 
to the intimate knowledge referred to in 
Karika I) only in three ways, viz., (0 by 
direct cognition by the senses, (ii) by logical 
inference, (in’) by testimony of the wise. 

It will now be shown that these methods 
are not always sure to lead us to true 
knowledge. The first method is liable to be 
vitiated by inherent incapacity or infirmity of 
the senses ; the second by the inability of the 
Buddhi to grasp ; and the third by our not 
being able to understand what is said. 

Accordingly, for epistemological enquiry, 
the whole subject has been divided into four 
main groups, viz., (*) false knowledge (Viparyaya), 
(ii) infirmity of sense organs (Ai^akti), (Hi) 
disinclination of the mind to ascertain true 
knowledge, i.e., its complacency (Tusti), (iv)

Andha-tamisra — corresponding to Avidya, 
Asmita, Raga, Dvesa and Abhinivesa of 
Patanjali. 

Each of these five main groups of false 
knowledge can be further sub-divided as shown 
in the next Karika — the total sub-divisions 
coming to sixty-two in number.

XLIX. The infirmities of the eleven 
organs, together with the infirmities of the 
Buddhi alone, are said to be the twenty-eight 
infirmities (referred to in Karika XLVII) ; 
Buddhi’s own infirmities can be divided into 
seventeen sub-divisions according to the impedi- 
ments to true knowledge in the nine varieties 
of Tusti (complacency) and the eight kinds of 
true knowledge (Siddhi), described below. 

Notes 

1 . The eleven infirmities of the organs such 
as deafness, blindness, paralysis, lunacy etc. 
are in fact ultimately traceable to Buddhi’s 
own infirmity, Buddhi being the creator of 
the entire sense- world. The nine varieties of 
Tusti and the eight varieties of impediments 
to true knowledge which may be found in 
the eight Siddhis, are similarly traceable to 
to Buddhi. But these seventeen varieties are 
independent of the sense-organs and have 
therefore been called Buddhi’s own infirmity.

Time, (to) Luck ; and five arising out of 
turning away from the five objects of enjoy- 
ment. 


Notes 

1. Tusti is really a kind of indolence 
which prevents a man from proceeding 
further in search of true knowledge — e.g., a 
man reads the Samkhya philosophy and 
understands that the object of this creation is 
the enjoyment and the final release of every 
soul however sinful ; understanding this, he 
thinks that his final release is certain ; it is 
only a question of time, or good luck or a 
little practice of some sort of austerity ; he 
remains content with this idea and makes no 
further attempt for self-realization. These are 
the four forms of internal Tusti referred to in 
the first part of the above Karika. 



138 


Safiikhya Karika of Isvaraktsna 


2. The five kinds of external Tusti are 
due to , abstinence from the five objects of 
sense enjoyment. Abstinence is no doubt neces- 
sary, but mere abstinence will not help a 
man much in the path of self-realization. A 
man, for instance, is quite content without 
wealth, because he thinks that it is difficult 
to acquire it, more difficult to spend it, and 
it may give rise to various troubles and so 
forth. Such complacency, due to indolence, 
is a real impediment to self-realization.

LII. Without a sense-world, there could 
not be a physical world and without a physical 
world there could not be enjoyment of the 
sense-world ; therefore, there are two different 
creations, viz-j the sense-world (Bhavakhya 
Sarga) and the physical world (Limgakhya 
Sarga). 

Notes 

1. This Karika is self-explanatory in the 
light of what has been said above. Gauda- 



140 


Samkhya Rarika of Isvarakrsna 


pada has made it clearer when he says that 
“Bhava” means the i*ratyaya Sarga of Karika 
XLVI and “Limga” means the physical world 
made of Tanmatras. 

It must however be borne in mind that 
these two worlds are inter-dependent. They 
are like two poles of a magnet and one 
cannot exist without the other. In the very 
first place, it has been stated in Karika XLI 
that the Limga of the sense-world cannot 
exist without a subtle body made of 
Tanmatras which arc ingredients taken from 
the physical world. 

Similarly, it will be said in Karikas LIV 
and LV below that in the physical universe 
all created beings beginning from Brahma 
down to a blade of grass have each a Limga 
— a collection of thoughts, and thoughts belong 
to the sense- world. 

The two worlds, viz.^ the sense-world and 
the physical world, are, therefore, not only 
inseparable but they act and react upon each 
other. This is so, because thoughts and gross 
energy (Tanmatras) are convertible. Energy 
coming from the external world ends in 
thoughts in our mind, and when we give 
expression to our thoughts, they become sound 
or heat or such other energy and disappear 
into space (See Introduction, Part II). The 



Karikas 


141 


conversion of thoughts into energy and 
vice-versa is a continuous process. This makes it 
clear that in this world no one has a separate 
existence, apart from the others. All are 
linked in a secret one-ness. Sri Aurobindo 
says : "For this is the truth in nature that 
this Ego which thinks itself a separate being, 
claims to live for itself, is not and cannot be 
separate, nor can it live to itself even if it 
would but rather all are linked together by a 
Secret One-ness. Each existence is continually 
giving out perforce from its stock. Out of its 
mental receipts from nature, or its vital and 
physical assets, a stream goes out to all that is 
around it. And always again it receives some- 
thing from its environment in return. For it is 
by this giving and receiving that it can effect 
its own growth while at the same time it helps 
the sum of things.” {Synthesis of Toga, p. 68), 
This conclusion of the Samkhya Philosophy 
has the support of modern science. For, 
according to science, nobody has any existence 
at all unless he has a relation to another 
object in the universe, and beyond space-time 
everything has only one common existence 
(Introduction, Part II). Thus, A. D. Ritchie 
says : "He (Eddington) points out, as White- 
head has done too, that there is no such 
thing as an independently existing individual. 



142 


Saihkhya Karika of Isvarakfs^ 


True, everything is what it is and not some- 
thing else ; but it is what it is in an environ- 
ment without which it will not be anything 

in particular, nor even exist at all yet, 

if it is true that the character of everything 
depends on its relations to other things — and 
modern theories of space-time hardly permit 
of any other assumption — if that is true, then 
there must be some universal relation capable 
of mathematical expression between the parts 
whatever they are, out of which things are 
constructed, and the whole lot of things taken 
together.” 

This is the wondrous world we live in. 
As stated above, both these worlds were 
created at a time when there was no time. 
The question, therefore, does not arise as to 
which of them was created first.

Karikas

creation is of one variety ; such, in brief, is 
the physical creation of the Bhutas {i.e.y 
Tanmatras). 


Notes 

1. The Super-human creation is of eight 
different kinds, viz., Brahma, Prajapatya, 
Aindra, Paitra, Gandharva, Yaksa, Raksasa and 
Pai^aca. 

The Sub-human creation consists of five 
different orders, viz., cattle, wild animals, birds, 
reptiles and immovable objects, e.g., trees, 
vegetables and minerals. 

2. Every created being in these fourteen 
kinds of creations has a suksma body — there 
are thus fourteen types of subtle bodies as 
stated above. 

The object of creation is said to be the 
evolution of the Liriiga from matter to spirit 
through successive rebirths. 

Thus, the Tantras which are based on the 
Samkhya philosophy assign eight millions of 
plant and animal lives as the sum of the 
preparations for a human birth. 

The Visnu Purana also says the same 
thing.

Notes 

1. The subtle body which is created by 
the Limga migrates through all these fourteen 
orders of creation. The Purusa as long as he 
has a Liihga has to take a rebirth after 
death. 

Death and rebirth are therefore inevitable. 
But when the Limga is dissolved, i.e., when the 
Purusa parts with Prakrti, there cannot be a 
rebirth, and the Purusa then attains liberation 
as stated in Karikas LXI-LXV (but see also 
Karika LXVI).

1- This Karika and the next Karika, too, 
seem at first to be a mere unnecessary 
repetition of what has already been said 
before. 

But the object is to remind us that the 
creation has an object and it is not a mere 
blind display of natural forces. The pheno- 
menon is that Nature is working of her own 
accord. But really all this is for the benefit 
of the Purusa. This Karika is, therefore, to 
remind us that, for reasons given in Karika 
XVII, Prakrti must have been organized by 
an intelligent being.

LVII. As milk is secreted in the cow’s 
udder for the nourishment of the calf and 
as the said secretion automatically ceases when 
the calf has grown up, so does Nature act 
spontaneously for the release of the Purusa 
(and ceases to act when the object is attained) ,

Notes 

1. It is suggested in this Karika that if 
we keep in mind that the universe is a single 
organization (like the organism of the cow’s 
body) there should be no mystery about 
inanimate forces like the Gunas working like 
an animate person with a pre-thought. 

2. The next question that arises is : What 
is the object of this creation ? Why is it 
necessary to create a Purusa first and then to 
release him with such a great display or 
organization of forces ? The Avyakta could 
have always remained an Avyakta ; why did 
he create at all ? On this point neither 
Samkhya nor Vedanta can give us a satis- 
factory reply, as will be seen from the next 
Karika.

a curiosity engages himself in play, so does

public. Although some persons the 

dancing-master or the stage-manager) might 
have seen her, she would not desist from 
dancing until the entire audience- is satisfied. 

This is only an analogy and it is neither 
a proof nor an explanation which gives us 
any idea of the mystery of the creation. 

Much better is the other explanation, viz., 
that according to Saihkhya, not only are the 
Purusas many, but the Prakrtis are also many, 
so that each Purusa has his own Prakrti. 
This view has at least the merit of being 
scientific in the light of the new science which 
says that the physical world is subjective. We 
know that no two men see the same rainbow, 
although we think that we are all seeing the 
same rainbow, whenever there is a rainbow in the 
sky. Similarly, the theory of relativity has proved 
that no two creatures, living at two different 
points of space, can see the same world. There 
is, therefore no harm in thinking that each man 
creates his own world by his own Prakrti.

LX. Without any benefit to herscH’, 
Prakrti, who is endowed with the Gunas, serves 
in manifold ways and thereby does good 
to the Purusa who is the eternal reality 
but who being devoid of the Gunas (i.e., 
being inactive) does not requite her in any 
way. 


Notes 

1 . The most important thing to note 
here is the adjective Sat or Aguna before 
the word Purusa. It shows that the Purusa 
is the only one Avyakta referred to in Karika 
X and that Prakrti is quite a different 
thing. 

What then is Prakrti ? If she had been 
as real as the Purusa himself, the latter could 
not have missed her. He, having become now 
the all-pervading Consciousness Its^f, sees the 
whole truth at a glance ; he sees nothing but 
the truth and cannot miss anything which is 
true. How can Prakrti then disappear from 
his view, if she is anything real ? In the 
next five Karikas an answer to this most 
important question will be found.

prakrteh sukumarataram-

LXI. (The Purusa thinks) “I have now 
come to know that there is no other easily 
comprehensible (phenomenal) cause of the 
creation than Prakrti — Prakrti who knowing 
that she has been seen by a Purusa will 
never again come to the view of the said 
Purusa”. 

Notes 

1. Here the word “Sukumaratara” is very 
suggestive. According to Gaudapada it means 
“that which can be easily understood”. 

2. The Purusa must first understand that 
Prakrti is only the phenomenal cause of this 
creation and is not the ultimate reality. It 
has already been said in Karika XLVIII that not 
to know this is Tamas or Avidya. The 
Purusa must first get rid of this Avidya ; and 
only then he can proceed to know his own 
self and&gt; after knowing it, part with Prakrti 
for ever. This is implied by the expression 
“iti me matirbhavati" at the end of the first 
line of this Karika. 

On attaining this knowledge, the Purusa 
will at once know that so long he was being 



152 


Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsm 


worked by Prakrti. What he will then under- 
stand, has been stated in the next Karika. 
The connecting link between these two Karikas 
is the word “Tasmat” with which Karika LXII 
begins. (See also Karika LXV). 

LXII. 51 5nft i 

^ snsnw irarfh: n ii 

tasman-na badhyate-’ddha 

namucyate na 'pi samsarati kascit I 
samsarati badhyate mucyate ca 
nana-’sraya prakrtih II 

LXII. For this reason (the Purusa now 
understands) it is only the Prakrti, in her 

manifold forms, that suffers bondage, migrates 
and is finally liberated ; the Purusa is never 
under bondage, nor is he liberated, nor does 
he migrate. 

Notes 

1. The Purusa being all-pervading con- 
sciousness cannot undergo any modification. 
He always remains the same in all successive 
births. Being static, he does not move, nor 

is there any place for him to go to because 
he is always present at every place. 

This is a common ground for all Indian 
Philosophies. According to Buddhism, it is 



Karikh 


153 


only the “Saipskara” the Buddhi or the 

Liihga) that migrates. So say the Upanisads. 
So says the Gita. The next question is how 
does Prakrti bind herself and how does she 
release herself. This question will be answered 
in the next Karika.

^ II II 

rupaih saptabhir-eva tu

LXIII. Prakyti binds herself by the seven 
forms (of thoughts) and she herself releases 
herself through the remaining one form, for 
the benefit of the Purusa. 

Notes 

1. The reference here is to Karika No. 
XXIII, where it is said that the Buddhi is a 
mere collection of thoughts which are divisible 
into eight categories. All these thoughts except 
one, viz-i Jnana, are creations of Prakrti, and 
she alone can terminate them by natural 
means such as are prescribed, say, in the 
Patanjala Philosophy or in Karika LXIV 
below. 



154 


Haihkhya Karika of Uvarakrsna 


It is, therefore, said in this Karika that 
Prakrti binds herself by seven kinds of thoughts, 
VIZ’, virtue, vice, ignorance, attachment, non- 
attachment, power and want of power. When 
a man gets rid of all these kinds of thoughts, 
he parts with Prakrti for ever. These seven 
kinds of thoughts are like a screen over his 
head 'and as soon as they are removed, he 
sees the reality which is he himself. He cannot 
remove the screen himself being entirely 
inactive. 

This will be made clearer in the next 
Karika — where it will be also explained why 
Purusa cannot part with Prakrti unless Prakrti 
herself parts from him first.

LXIV. In this way, practising the 
twenty-four Tattvas, there results that Jnana 
( consciousness ) — “I do not exist”, “nothing 
is mine”, “I am not” — which Jhana is 
all-comprehensible, without impurity, and 
absolute.

155 


Notes 

1. This Karika speaks of the Purusa who 
has been able to destroy his ego-sense. One 
means to destroy it is by constant practice of 
the twentyfour Tattvas. 

In Karika XXXVII it was said that this 
can be done only with the help of the 
Buddhi. Buddhi is Prakrti’s own creation. 
Without it, the Purusa cannot enjoy, cannot 
think, nor can do anything for self-realization 
or for any other purpose. 

Enjoyment (which includes suffering of 
miseries), and the subsequent liberation of the 
soul, constitute but one single natural process 
of evolution of the Buddhi from ignorance to 
perfect wisdom. The Purusa is here only a 
passive spectator. 

2. The Jnana which is referred to in this 
Karika does not mean symbolipal knowledge 
or physical experience. It is intimate knowledge. 
It is consciousness itself. 

3. In the next Karika, we shall know 
what is Samkhya’s conception of Prakrti, or 
in other words, what the liberated soul will 
know the Prakrti to be.

LXV. By that intimate knowledge (re- 
ferred to in the preceding Karika) and being 
restored to himself, the Purusa sees, like a 
spectator (from a distance), the Prakrti who 
has now become unproductive and devoid of 
her seven forms. 

Notes 

1. What does the Purusa now see of the 
Prakrti ? Prakrti’s body, as said above in 
Karika LIX, consisted only of the Buddhi and 
the other Tattvas which are a creation of 
the Buddhi. Her shape, as said above, is the 
seven forms of thoughts. Where could the 
thoughts go ? How could they become un- 
productive or "inoperative ? 

Thoughts, says Samkhya, are not objective. 
The moon, for instance, is an objective some- 
thing ; she will go on moving in the sky 
whether there be a man to see her or not. 
But thoughts, or feelings like pleasure or pain, 
are not like that. Unless a man sees them 
{i.e.y think of them), they cannot be said to 
have an existence of their own. We have got 
all sorts of thoughts in our mind — but they 



Karikas 


157 


are all dead thoughts, and it is only when we 
recall any one of them to our consciousness 
that it becomes a thought — a living thought. 
Otherwise, thoughts do not exist in their own 
right. 

Similarly, now that the Buddhi has parted 
with the Piurusa, all the stored-up thoughts 
become dead thoughts without a seer to see 
them. They have lost that connection with 
the conscious element which so long made them 
what they were. They now become unobserv- 
able and un-knowable or non-existent. 

The liberated Purusa now understands 
this. To him therefore Prakrti has no separate 
existence. She so long existed in his own 
mind. 

2. As said above, the present Karika 
refers to the Purusa who has been able to 
completely sever his connection with Prakrti 
by destroying his ego-sense. He become Pure 
Consciousness. His individuality is lost in the 
Avyakta. No question arises whether he can 
again be born, (r.jT., Brahma-Sutra IV, 4, 
1-6). But such cases are rare. Ordinarily, the 
ego-sense is not completely destroyed even 
after attainment of true knowledge. 

A Purusa even after he has attained true 
knowledge continues to think, now under- 
stand”, “I am such and such”. His connection 



158 


Sarhkhya Karika of livarakrsna 


with Prakrti still exists. Such cases will be 
discussed in the next Karika and it will be 
shown that such a Purusa will not be born 
again but his individuality will continue.

LXVI. One (the witness) says, “I have 
seen her” (I understand what she is), and so 
understanding, becomes indifferent ; the other 
saying “I have been seen”, desists (from 
further prompting) ; thus although there is 
still conjunction between the two, there is no 
need for further creation {i.e., rebirth). 

Notes 

1. One essential condition for migration 
or re-birth is that the Limga at the time of 
death should be able to create a new subtle 
body of one of the fourteen types mentioned 
above. 

In the case of the Purusa who has been 
able to suppress all thoughts except the ego- 
sense, his limga being devoid of all thoughts 



Karikas 


159 


except that one, cannot create a new subtle 
body, just as a fried seed cannot germinate. 
Such a Puruiia after death cannot be born 
again. 

Such a Purusa after his death will be free 
from bondage, he can assume any form he 
likes, and can go anywhere he likes (Compare 
Brahma-Sutra IV, 4, 7-21. See Patahjala Sutra, 
I, 25, II — 4). He is absolutely a free soul.

LXVII. Even after attainment of perfect 
wisdom as a result of the seven kinds of 
thoughts, beginning with virtue, having become 
inoperative, the Purusa remains attached to 
the body (continues to live) for a while ; 
because of his Samskara which continues to 
function, just as a potter’s wheel continues to 
move for a while by its owr^ inertia even after 
the motive power has been withdrawn. 

Notes 

1. This Karika says that a man does not 
die immediately on attainment of intimate 



160 SaAikhya Kariha of Iharakrsna 


knowledge. He will have to live his allotted 
life. 

Vedanta also says the same thing (See

all that was necessary, the Purusa attains that 
release which is both certain and final 
(because he will not be born again). 

Notes 

1. This Karika refers to Karika LXVI 
only, because the Purusa referred to in Karijcas 
LXIV-LXV has lost his individuality and 
nothing more can be said about him.

LXIX. This abstruse philosophy, accessory 
to the attainment of the final objects of 
the Purusa, and which deals with the origin, 
existence and dissolution of all beings, was 
fully expounded by the great sage (Kapila). 

Notes 

1. Here ends Gaudapada’s Bhasya — but 
he ended it with the following words : 

“These are the seventy K^ikas and their 
Bh^ya by Gaudapada.” It seems clear that 
he had nothing more to say about Karika 

LXX which is self-explanatory and to which he 
had already referred in his notes on Karika I. 

But some commentators think that one 
Karika must have been missing — otherwise 
Gaudapada would not have reckoned the 

LXIX-th Karika as the LXX-th — more 

especially when it is well-known that the 
Samkhya Karikas were seventy in number. 

After great trouble, the so-called missing 
Karika has been reconstructed as in the foot- 
note below*^ and has been given a place just

Saihkhya Karika of Iharakrsna 


below Karika LX. It has been conjectured 
that this Karika was wilfully deleted by some- 
one in order to show that Saihkhya philosophy 
was not theistic. 

But it is the main teaching of the Saihkhya 
philosophy that God directly did not create 
the universe. He being not active. (Part IV 
of the Introduction). 

This patent fact cannot be concealed by 
stealing a Karika or two — and to deny this, 
will be a denial of the whole philosophy. 
If a Karika was wilfully deleted, why were 
the commentaries allowed to remain intact ? 

It is also strange that this missing Karika 
was missed by all commentators from the 
time of Isvarakrsna downwards. 

Apart from all such considerations, the 
missing Karika, as has been constructed now, 
is itself a proof that it could not have formed 
a part of the Saihkhya Philosophy. It does 
not add anything and it is only a clumsy 
repetition. Moreover, the very word “Nirguna” 
which occurs there, indicates that it could not 
have been written by Isvarakrsna. According 
to Saihkhya, Gupas, as well as any other 
thing in the world, exist in latent form in 
their root cause, viz., the Avaykta. In this 
sense, it will be a misnomer to call the 
Avyakta, Nirguna. The word used in Saihkhya 



Karikas 


163 


is Aguna and not Nirguna (See Karika LX 
above). The word Nirguna does not occur 
anywhere in the Karikas.
