
o	The choice of word “enjoyer” puzzles us. We could understand pleasant sensations as an enjoyment, but there are unpleasant sensations for the body too. We can understand Gita’s statement if, the consciousness enjoys both of them.

Gautam Buddha and Ananda, his disciple, were passing through a forest. They had just crossed a small stream. Buddha is an old man, and he says to Ananda, "I am feeling very thirsty, you just go back and from that stream bring me some water in my bowl." Ananda took the bowl and went back. But meanwhile a few bullock carts had passed through the stream and had disturbed its water completely; it had become muddy. The water was not drinkable. So Ananda went back to Buddha told what happened. Buddha said, "Just go there and wait. The dirt will settle and, soon the water will be clear." Ananda did not want to go, but Buddha insisted "Don't change your mind, just go back." Ananda went back and was surprised to see that the water was as crystal-clear! All that was foreign - the dirt, the dead leaves - had all gone. The water had come to its purity. He filled the begging bowl of Gautam Buddha. But Ananda he was aware of the question, "Why was Buddha so adamant that I have to come back here to bring water? I could have brought it from another stream. Why this stream? There must be some reason." And as he came back towards Buddha the reason became clear. The leaves and the dirt, which are not natural to the stream, are bound to leave the stream as stream is always flowing. Same is true about our thoughts, our emotions, our sentiments etc. They all are foreign to our consciousness. If we just wait patiently, they all will disappear without any effort on our side. Our purity will assert itself on its own accord. 




It will keep discussions easy to understand and interesting. 

This book describes the process of Yoga. It explains, “What is consciousness? and how Yoga leads to consciousness?” 

In this book, we will define the term ‘Spirituality’

We will see that we can be spiritual in different ways and reach the same goal. It helps us understand several aspects of consciousness.


. My eyesight did catch your presence, but chose not to pay attention. 


As noted in the question above, we do not need to be spiritual to live a good life. We can “live a good life” in many ways. Everyone has his idea of what a good life is. Everyone tries his best to live it. Spirituality offers an idea of “living a good life”. Spirituality has lot of experience. Spirituality helps us alleviate this fear of death. It avoids the misery. It teaches us to live life in present moment, without creating bonds of attachments. 
Hence, its idea of “good life” is worth studying. As both Shri Krishna and Lord Buddha have said, wise men take the path of spirituality.





	Reading and writing about consciousness is difficult, verbose, and boring. To keep this book interesting, we will keep this book short and in a question-answer format. We will see many stories in this book. They help understand various aspects of consciousness.

According to the story, Lord Vishnu took the Mohini avatar, cheated the demons, and delivered the elixir to the gods to make them victorious. The avatar stories do not include the Mohini avatar among one of the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu. This exclusion seems confusing; it becomes evident when we go over the story of Bhasmasur. 


A fish, which is always under water, yet cannot see water. We are ignorant about the consciousness, 

Over a period, these reactions become habits. Consciousness saves these habits for 
later use.

However, there are certain pre-conditions. When we do breathing exercises, it pushes breath all over the body. At the same time, we are aware of every sensation within body. We do not react to the painful sensation and wish it to go away. We are not attach to the pleasurable sensations, and expect it to remain it that way


16.	We react to a sensation. If sensation is pleasurable, we want it to continue. This is a craving reaction. If sensation is painful, we want it to stop. This is an aversion reaction. For every sensation, there is a reaction. The type of reaction does not matter. As long as the reaction exits, it gives feedback to consciousness that this particular thought or feeling is working very well, which means it created lot of sensations. These sensations are signal to consciousness to keep having the same thought or feeling. Without the reaction, mind cannot get feedback, as if the electric circuit is not complete. In that case, mind stops running that thought or feeling. Not reacting to sensations is the only way to make mind pure.

For example, if we keep eating sugar, soon it becomes tasteless. 

1.	The sensations are of two types – with a cause and without a cause. When ears hear a sound, we know that the sensation is caused by the sound that hit ears. There are sensations all over body that are without any cause. The movement of air in lungs is without any cause. They are called Pranic sensa


Often, two pieces of information contradict each other. Nevertheless, we can loosely string these bits and pieces together! 

Generally, we come up with a precise definition to understand a concept. However, if someone defines a term A using term B and then defines the term B by referring to term A, then the definitions become illogical, confusing, and wrong. We acknowledge that when we come to consciousness, it can be expressed using other concepts, which in turn points back to consciousness. For that reason, it is defined as “Not that, not that, not that”. 
We do not have a precise definition of consciousness. 

There are many other similar indicators. They all are mystical in nature. 

Some other answered it as “if you try to find it, you cannot find it; if you look closely, you are consciousness”.   

The concept of consciousness explained here is a product of eastern culture. 

However, when we come to consciousness, it defined using other concepts, which in turn points back to consciences. 

You have to take one position, like “there is no consciousness” or “everything is consciousness” or anything in between. It is similar to finding a suitable spot on moving merry-go-round. After that, y

Science cannot prove consciousness and it is not even a scientific term. I am not interested into Spirituality. I do not want to get into Yoga. 

The characters of these stories relate to consciousness. They help understand various aspects of consciousness. Many of these stories are from Ramayana. Shri Ram, hero of Ramayana, represents consciousness and other characters represent processes in Yoga.

We, as a humanity, do not have a clear idea of the consciousness.

This is a very difficult question. Both

Science has not yet come up with a way to understand the consciousness. Hence, we have to turn to spiritualit

We will review the current scientific view later in this book. it does not mean that we know nothing about consciousness.
The collective knowledge of humanity about consciousness is stored in the philosophy and religion 

1.	Breath has air and an energetic part in it. Since mind is all over the body, the energetic part of breath must reach all over body. 
 Even when someone makes a best efforts to expresses, they get a feeling that they could not express it completely.

Reader: How does spirituality define “living a good life”? 


Any person, who has no interest in these topics, will not read this book. In addition, any answer that I could give will not satisfy him. Nevertheless, this is a question is valid, for those, who are committed to studies of these type of topics. The answer is a resounding yes, it is surely worthwhile to peruse these topics, and these pursuits are not in vain.

Consciousness And Yoga and Ramayana


1.	Consciousness is a field; it has no mass, so there is no way to interact with it directly. The only way to interact with is through mind and sensations. 
2.	We can experience consciousness in present moment only.

Author: 
It is hard to imagine that any of us will be able to finish the study of spirituality in our lifetime. We all are co-travelers in this long journey.

A student of spirituality will be able to face death without fear. This is the single most important test and value of spirituality.

We can classify all of above information as identity, memory, or emotions. 


Consciousness is similar to the magnetic field. Instead of north and south poles, consciousness has two centers – one at the top of the head and one at the bottom of spine. In Yoga, we call them Sahastrar and Muladhar Chakras. In Yoga, top of the head is treated as north side and bottom of the spine as south side. Instead of green and red colors of magnet, we have orange and blue colors in body.
		Due to constant interaction between these two centers, the conscious field is created and sustained. Energy flows from bottom of spine towards top of head and to the rest of the body. There is unites with consciousness, which in term, comes down through spine and all over the body. A strong energy center produces strong conscious field and vice-versa. The correct term to describe the field is “energy-conscious field”. Consciousness is simplified name of energy-conscious field. It is similar to describing an electromagnetic field as magneticness, which is not an English word!
	In magnet, north and south poles divide magnet in middle. According to Yoga, these centers dominate entire body. Muladhar Chakra, which is a source of energy, has its lines spreading all over the body. Yoga calls the Nadis. Yoga estimates that there are 72,000 nadis carry energy through the body. It also means that Sahastrar, which is a source of consciousness, also spreads consciousness all over the body. Together, we get the energy-conscious field, in which our body exits. 
	Yoga asserts that the energy-conscious field comes first and body is secondary. In other words, energy-conscious field arranges our body to suit itself. The energy-conscious field creates and holds our body using five elements created by energy, generated at Muladhar Chakra (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) and consciousness, generated at Sahastrar. If the energy-conscious field weakens below certain level, we die. Even if we die, the energy-conscious field can carry and assume the ownership of next body.
	The entire process of Yoga is to strengthen this energy-conscious field, so that it can go higher and higher levels. At the highest level, this energy-conscious field expands exponentially. It is called as Samadhi. The word “Bramha” means expanding consciousness. There are many terms in Yoga that point to same expanding consciousness. We will use the term Universal Consciousness. Sage Patanjali described as the eighth and final step of Yoga. Many yogis all over the world have reported experience of Universal Consciousness. It gives us a confidence that Universal Consciousness is a real thing, and not a figment of imagination.
Reader: How does the experience of Universal Consciousness feel?


It is unclear (to me) if the body comes first or the consciences come first. 

Yoga has a pose called as The “Seated Forward Bend Pose” or “Paschimottanasana“. The word “Paschim” means west and “ottan” means rise. The name means rise of energy from west side of body! The spine is at the west side of the body and energy rises through it.



. At the time of birth of Shri Ram, Sage Durvasa told us a story that happened long time ago. Once there was a war between the gods and the demons. When the demons were losing the war, they took shelter of sage Bhrigu’s wife. At that time, she gave them an assurance of safety. Lord Vishnu, the commander of god’s side, became angry when He saw that they had taken shelter of Bhrigu’s wife. With His sharp-edged discus, He decapitated sage Bhrigu’s wife. When the sage Bhrigu saw that his wife had been killed, he became furious. He cursed Lord Vishnu, “Because You killed my wife though she did not deserve it, You will take birth in the mortal world and live in separation from Your wife for many years.” Lord Vishnu said, “I have accepted the curse which you uttered for the benefit of the world.” Lord Vishnu has descend to this world as Shri Ram. 


This is my (normal) consciousness. That is (universal) consciousness. My (normal) consciousness is a part of (universal) consciousness. (The reason I know this to be true is that) when consciousness divides into parts, it remains consciousness.

Why and how universal consciousness loses its universal state? 

 
Why and How Universal Consciousness Loses Its Universal State?
In this infinite universal consciousness, for reasons we do not know of, there arises a spirit of enquiry concerning itself. Being consciousness, it is aware of itself, so the question “Who am I?” arises in it without any words or associated concepts.
Yogis say that the universal consciousness wishes to know itself. It is one; it wants to be many.



They are honest, hard-working, and proud people.

	Some of them practice Yoga primarily its health, body, and mind benefits. Some join Yoga to fix their back pain or other bodily problem. Some join Yoga because it is accessible to all body types, shapes, and age. Some like Yoga because it is a go-at-your-pace, non-competitive exercise, and it gives space for themselves. Some go to Yoga classes to meet other people and enjoy the belonging to a group feeling. Someone may do Yoga for wrong reasons, and still get the benefits of doing Yoga!

What are the energy centers? How do I activate them?


What is Conscousness? 
The word ‘Consciousness’ refers to one's awareness. This awareness may be of thoughts, memories, feelings, sensations and environment. When an individual knows that his attention is on a pertucular place or thught. This awareness exists in all our body parts. This awareness works behind the scene. Our sense organs come in contact with other objects. for ex., ears listen to music. The ears come in contact with sound. The ears can 'hear' the sound because there is a consciousness in the ears. When a person is dead, there is no consciousness in their body and their ears, so they cannot hear. Thus, it is the consciouenss that works behinds the senses and enables them to function. Our body gets old but the consciousness is does not change.
If an individual does not know that he is percieving somethingm then he is not consciousness. 
This defination of consciousness is simple to understand. But Yoga uses this term in much broader way. 
Sages tell us that just as our body has consciousness, the entire world also has same consciousness. This is not just a theoritical concept. When a Yogi enters into Samadhi, the state of higer conscoiusness, he experiences the entire world as consious.  


here is one more way to understand this term. Yoga says there are four state of consciousness that we experience. First is awake state where we are aware of ourselves.  Second state is Dreame state. There is a Deep Sleep state, where we are not aware of being awake or dreaming.

What does Science say about consciousness?

 
Why Yoga?
	
Reader asks: Why should I do Yoga?
Author: Yoga poses can be very challenging. They provide very good exercise. Yoga improves balance, flexibility, and muscle strength. It increases blood flow, boosts immunity, and maintains nervous system. It increases digestive power and reduces weight. It improves lung capacity, which helps breathe better. It helps focus, helps sleep deeper, and gives piece of mind.

Reader asks: These are the same benefits as any other exercise. What is so special about Yoga?
Author:
 
The consciousness is neutral. It is very hard to notice. It is like air – we are unable to smell it unless some scent is added. Energy is vibrant. It is much more natural to feel. Which is why, in Yoga, we focus more on energy.
In physics, an atom has a core with positive and neutral components. The consciousness is like the core of an atom except for the positive charge in it. It is always neutral and is the primary life sustaining force. The energy is like an electron except for the negative charge in it. It is always in motion and is attracted to the neutral consciousness. 



Limits of Higher Consciousness
Author: The collection of stories answers difficult questions using an easy to understand story. They are called as Purana. In these stories, Lord Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are the gods   represent higher consciousness. 


 
I have so many questions. 

 

Reader: What are levels of consciousness?

Ramayana may be helpful in learning Yoga. But, before I agree, I have several questions. 




Define yoga
Where do I begin this journey?
What benefits will this journey give me? Higher consciousness
What knowledge do I need before beginning?
The importance and history of Ramayana
Difficulties I may face

 
We begin where we are. We do not have experience of higher consciousness and we do not understand the term higher consciousness.
